      <h2>Encoding</h2>

      <p>Arabic script is encoded in the Unicode standard <em>semantically</em>, meaning that every letter receives only a single Unicode character, no matter how many different contextual shapes it may exhibit.</p>

      <p>Unicode also has a partial set of <em>non-semantic</em> encoded characters for the Arabic script, under blocks <em>Arabic Presentation Forms-A</em> and <em>Arabic Presentation Forms-B</em>, which are deprecated and should not be used in general interchange.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="h_direction">
      <h2>Direction</h2>

      <p>Arabic script is written from right to left. Numbers, even Arabic numbers, are written from left to right, as is text in a script that is normally left-to-right.</p>

      <p>When the main script is Arabic, the layout and structure of pages and documents are also set from right to left.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</a> details an algorithm for rendering right-to-left text and covers a myriad of situations in mixing different kinds of characters. A simpler explanation of the basics of the algorithm exists in the W3C article <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. You can refer to these documents for more information about Unicode’s bidirectional algorithm.</p>

      <p>A brief overview of the bidirectional (<span class="qterm">bidi</span> for short) algorithm follows, because the direction is an essential part of how Arabic script is used.</p>

      <p>The characters of a text are digitally stored and transferred in the same order that they are typed by a user. This is the order in which the text is read and pronounced by people and held in memory by software applications, as shown in <a href="#order_in_memory"></a> for a sample text.</p>

      <figure id="order_in_memory">
        <img src="images/order-in-memory.svg" alt="The order of characters in memory">

        <figcaption>The order of characters in memory</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>But the order used when displaying text is different. The purpose of the bidi algorithm is to find display positions for the characters of a text. These positions are solely used for displaying texts. <a href="#order_when_displayed"></a> shows the same sample text when prepared for display with the bidi algorithm.</p>

      <figure id="order_when_displayed">
        <img src="images/order-when-displayed.svg" alt="The order of characters when displayed">

        <figcaption>The order of characters when displayed</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>An initial step of the process involves determining each paragraph’s <span class="qterm">base direction</span>: whether the paragraph is left-to-right or right-to-left. The base direction is either explicitly set by the author, inherited from the page, or (typically for user-generated content) detected based on the content of the paragraph. The base direction has two important uses later in the process.</p>

      <p>The next step is to split the text into <span class="qterm">directional runs</span>. Each directional run is a sequence of characters with the same direction.</p>

      <figure id="directional_runs">
        <img src="images/directional-runs.svg" alt="Splitting a text into 3 directional runs">

        <figcaption>Splitting a text into 3 directional runs</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Inside each run, all the characters follow the same order. The runs themselves are ordered for visual representation from left to right or from right to left, depending on the base direction of the paragraph. <a href="#order_of_directional_runs"></a> demonstrates an example of this. This is the first effect of the base direction.</p>

      <figure id="order_of_directional_runs">
        <img src="images/order-of-directional-runs.svg" alt="The effect of base direction on the order of runs">

        <figcaption>The effect of base direction on the order of runs</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Unicode has a <span class="qterm">bidi category</span> property defined for each character that is used to determine the direction of each character. All the Arabic letters are marked as right-to-left characters, while Latin characters have the left-to-right category.</p>

      <p>Some characters, mostly punctuations, are <span class="qterm">neutral</span>. The direction of these characters is derived from their surrounding characters. If a neutral character is surrounded by characters of the same direction (e.g. an space surrounded by Arabic letters), it gets the direction of its neighbors. Otherwise (e.g. a space between an Arabic and a Latin, or a neutral character appearing at the start or the end of a paragraph), the neutral character gets its direction from the paragraph’s base direction. This is another effect of the base direction in the bidi algorithm.</p>

      <p>The above explanation of the bidi algorithm is highly simplified, to convey only the essentials of how Arabic text is transformed for rendering. The actual algorithm deals with many more character types and edge cases. Please refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a> for more information or <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</a> for the official detailed documentation.</p>

        <h2>Joining Behavior of Characters</h2>

        <p>Arabic script is cursive; i.e, characters are joined to their neighbors. For this purpose, each Arabic letter has at most four different shapes that allows it to join to its neighbors: beside the <span class="qterm">isolated</span> form, there are <span class="qterm">initial</span>, <span class="qterm">medial</span>, and <span class="qterm">final</span> forms. Their purposes, as their names suggest, are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Isolated shape:</strong> Used when the letter is not joined to any other letter.</li>

          <li><strong>Initial shape:</strong> Used when the letter is joined only to its next (left-side) letter.</li>

          <li><strong>Medial shape:</strong> Used when the letter is joined from its both sides.</li>

          <li><strong>Final shape:</strong> Used when the letter is joined only to its previous (right-side) letter.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>shows all four shapes of character <span class="uname">U+0645 ARABIC LETTER MEEM</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">م</span>).</p>

        <figure id="letter_shapes">
          <img src="images/letter-shapes.png" alt="Four different shapes for joining to previous or succeeding letters">

          <figcaption>Four different shapes for joining to previous or succeeding letters</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>For each Arabic letter, based on the joining behavior of its neighbors, one of its shapes is used in writing. demonstrates how letters join to form a word.</p>

          <figcaption>Joining letters by using their various shapes</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>There are different categories of characters based on their joining behavior, but most of the Arabic letters are either <span class="qterm">dual joining</span> or <span class="qterm">right joining</span>. Dual joining characters can join from both sides. Like the character in image 1, these types of characters have all the four shapes mentioned above. Right joining characters only join to their previous (right-side) character. These characters only have isolated and final shapes, for they don’t join to their next character.</p>

        <figure id="right_joining_letter">
          <img src="images/right-joining-letter.svg" alt="Right-joining letters only have two forms of final and isolated.">

          <figcaption>Right-joining letters only have two forms of final and isolated.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Almost all the non-alphabetical characters are <span class="qterm">non-joining</span>. The few exceptions will be discussed in this document.</p>

        <p>Please refer to The Unicode Standard Version 8.0, Section 9.2, for full explanation of Arabic cursive joining.</p>

        <section id="h_joining_and_spacing">
          <h2>Joining and Intra-Word Spaces</h2>

          <p>The only spaces inside Arabic words are created near characters that are not dual-joining. When adjusing intra-word spaces (i.e. the space inside the words) only these spaces can be adjusted. Moving two joined characters closer to or further from each other creates undesirable results.</p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="h_ligatures">
        <h2>Ligatures</h2>

        <p>Almost all the writing styles of Arabic script use a special shape when letters <span class="lettername">lam</span> and <span class="lettername">alef</span> are joined. Most Arabic fonts include mandatory ligatures for this combination. Ignoring this ligature, as shown in , leads to wrong rendering of text.</p>

        <figure id="laam-alef-ligature">
          <img src="images/laam-alef-ligature.png" alt="Correct and wrong ways of rendering letter lam followed by letter alef">

          <figcaption>Correct and wrong ways of rendering letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> followed by letter <span class="lettername">alef</span></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This shape is not limited to the combination of <span class="uname">U+0644 ARABIC LETTER LAM</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">ل</span>) with <span class="uname">U+0627 ARABIC LETTER ALEF</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">ا</span>). Variations of letter <span class="lettername">alef</span> such as <span class="uname">U+0622 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH MADDA ABOVE</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">آ</span>) and <span class="uname">U+0623 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH HAMZA ABOVE</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">أ</span>) and also variations of letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> follow the same rules as well. Combination with diacritics does not affect these ligatures. Each of these ligatures also provides a special shape for joining from its right side (to the preceding letter).</p>

        <h3>Arabic Style and Calligraphy</h3>

        <p>Arabic styling and writing has its origins in Islamic art and civilization, and was widely used to decorate mosques and palaces, as well as to create beautiful manuscripts and books, and especially to copy the <em>Kor'an</em>. Arabic script is cursive, making it viable to support different geometric shapes overlapping and composition. Words can be written in a very condensed form as well as stretched into elongated shapes, and the scribes and artists of Islam labored with passion to take advantage of all these possibilities.</p>

        <p>From the beginning of Arabic calligraphy, two tendencies or two types of styles can be seen emerging: writing for the decoration of mosques and sculptures, which was complex and highly decorative, and writing styles reserved for writing the <em>Kor'an</em>, which were easier to use and more readable.</p>

        <p>Writing styles then evolved under the influences of cultural diversity, leading to regional calligraphic schools and styles (<em>Kufi</em> in Iraq, <em>Farsi</em> and <em>Taʻliq</em> in Persia, or <em>Diwani</em> in Turkey). Additional differences arose depending on the purpose of writing, such as the copying and dissemination of the <em>Korʼan</em>.</p>

        <p>In general we group under the generic term <em><strong>Naskh</strong></em> (copy/inscription) the scripts which are meant for reading at smaller sizes and are suitable for books and texts to be read, e.g. the <em>Korʼan</em>, and as <em><strong>Kufic</strong></em> the highly stylized font styles used for ornamentation and more styled writings. Nevertheless, the rich evolution of the Arabic script led to the distinctive enumeration of a number of additional named styles.<br>
        Two other styles are used as synonyms for <em>Kufic</em> and <em>Naskh</em>: <em>Mabsut</em> (<em>wa mustaqīm</em>) is a form of style that is straight angled and elongated, [which dominated the copies of <em>Korʼan</em> in eighth and ninth centuries], and <em>Muqawwar</em> (<em>wa mudawar</em>) is a form of style that is curved and rounded.</p>

      <section id="h_different_writing_styles">
        <h3>Different Writing Styles</h3>

        <p>Basics and principles of Arabic writing were defined by <em>Ibn Moqlah</em> (886-940 Higra), who defined six styles of writing: <em>Kufi</em>, <em>Thuluth</em>, <em>Naskh</em>, <em>Ruqʻa</em>, <em>Taʻliq</em> and <em>Diwani</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Multi-context joining</strong></p>

            <p>Rendering of letters depends not only on their place in the word (initial, medial, final) but also on their neighboring letters, i.e. the letter they join with. Each letter has a different appearance in each combination.</p>

            <figure>
              <img style="width: 324px; height: 79px;" alt="Different initial shape of noon" src="images/differentInitialNoon.jpg">

              <figcaption>Initial letter noon, showing many different forms.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Fonts don't always comply with or respect this kind of <span class="qterm">tuning</span>. To do so, fonts need many glyphs in order to adapt to each context. In more modern typefaces some of these connections are implemented by ligatures, but ligatures can't capture or cover all joining behavior.</p>

            <p>In the two left most words, the initial noon differs in that one raises a kind of stroke. This property of raising a stroke is common for a number of letters (beh, teh, noon, theh) which are taller than their connected letters in order to be distinguished in some contexts, such as<img style="float: middle; width: 37px; height: 31px;" alt="Beh with stroke before seen" src="images/bsl.jpg"> vs. <img style="float: middle; width: 43px; height: 39px;" alt="Beh without stroke after seen" src="images/sbl.jpg"> , or to resolve ambiguity.

        <p>Arabic script counts 26 letters, and mostly 19 basic shapes. Since letters change according to their position in the word, Arabic set of glyph may range to more than one hundred shapes. If one count possible ligatures, and different combination of joining forms (see above), the number of glyph can increase further. Not sure that typeface design can accommodate all needs, even though some present typefaces can run hundred of shapes.</p>

        <p>Early typefaces, some still in use today, were designed with some facilities. Designer of those differs in their simplification hypothesis. For example, one of the first approach is to use "type writer style", that is a same glyph for different positions in a word. This is the case for initial and medial shape for most of the letters (example here). It is generally the browser default font for Arabic script. A more unifying approach is the use of a single and detached glyph for each letter without joining (todo example here). Other approach were used resulting in more or less visually practical fonts.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, there is a large choice of fonts, and one can choose the font that best suits to one's typographical desire. However, one may also wishes to take into account some non typographical considerations like: (TBD later on)</p>

          <li>Font style for titles and banners and alike (small number of words), may differ from the style for content text (long text).</li>

          <li>Shapes and proportions (the size issue) in mixed texts</li>

        <p>There are a number of different ways to produce justified text in Arabic. In some cases several of these methods may be combined. In other cases, certain methods are disallowed.</p>

        <p>Typical methods include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Expansion or contraction of inter-word spaces.</li>

          <li>Expansion or contraction of intra-word spaces, ie. the space following a character in the middle of a word that doesn't join with the character that follows it.</li>

          <li>Use of wider glyph forms for certain characters.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>What are the rules for elongation of inter-character baselines, and how do they differ from one font style to another?</li>

      </div>

      <p>Of the four basic justification methods (flush left, flush right, justified, and centered), justified is the most challenging, as it requires changing the widths of the lines to a pre-defined measure. <span class="qterm">Measure</span> refers to the width of a column of text. In a justified paragraph the width of all the lines should be the same as the paragraph’s measure (except, of course, the last line).</p>

      <p>In Arabic there are six mechanisms for changing the width of a line of text. Each one has its limitations and considerations on when and how it can be applied. Furthermore, different typographers and calligraphers have divergent preferences for these mechanisms.</p>

      <p>An important factor in the application of these mechanisms is their success in creating an even <span class="qterm">color</span>. The color of the text refers to the amount of ink/blackness used to print or show a block of text. Color describes the density of the text against its background. Poorly justifying paragraphs can create uneven distribution of color.</p>

      <p>These mechanisms are not exclusive. Quite the contrary, they are commonly used simultaneously to produce better justified paragraphs. Combination of these mechanisms is discussed in <a href="#h_combination_of_the_mechanisms">Combination of the Mechanisms</a>.</p>

      <section id="h_adjusting_inter_word_spaces">
        <h2>Adjusting Inter-Word Spaces</h2>

        <p>This is the same mechanism widely used when justifying Latin scripts, where the width of the spaces between the words can be increased or decreased to change the width of the line.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/adjusting-inter-word-spaces.svg" alt="Aligning lines by increasing and decreasing spaces between the words.">

          <figcaption>Aligning lines by increasing and decreasing spaces between the words.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>A minimum width is defined for how much the space can be shrunk, because putting the words too close to each other creates aesthetic and legibility problems.</p>

        <p>Stretching the space too wide is also undesirable, but is utilized as a last resort when it is not possible to use other solutions to make fully justified paragraphs. In some applications a maximum width for the inter-word space is defined as a soft limit (compared to minimum width which is a hard limit). Reaching the maximum width makes the software to try to use other solutions for justification. If no other solution could yield the required result, the software would fall back to inter-word spacing and stretch the space past the maximum width.</p>

        <p>Depending solely on this mechanism for aligning lines in a justified paragraph can lead to unpleasant results, such as rivers (multiple stretched spaces appearing vertically close to each other and forming a white gap inside the paragraph) and uneven distribution of color in the paragraph. Hence, typographers generally use other mechanisms as well to minimize the effect of adjusting inter-word spaces.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="h_adjusting_intra_word_spaces">
        <h2>Adjusting Intra-Word Spaces</h2>

        <p>This solution alters the space between letters of each word to change the width of the text. Like adjusting inter-word spaces, this is used for Latin scripts as well, but using it for Arabic script involves considerations specific to Arabic. As noted in <a href="#h_joining_and_spacing">Joining and Intra-Word Spaces</a>, the principal consideration is that gaps between characters only exist for those letters that join only to the right, such as <span class="lettername">dal</span> and <span class="lettername">reh</span> . Adjustment of intra-word space is not relevant where one letter is joined to its neighbors.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/adjusting-intra-word-spaces.png" alt="Altering intra-word spaces between unjoined letters.">

          <figcaption>Altering intra-word spaces between unjoined letters.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Depending on the writing style and the typeface in use, different amounts of alteration to the intra-word space is acceptable for Arabic. Some writing styles allow more liberal adjustments to the closeness of the letter groups, while others can only accept small adjustments in this regard. In any case, much smaller adjustments can be used for intra-word spacing in comparison for inter-word spacing, which naturally is wider and tolerate bigger adjustments.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="h_alternative_shapes">
        <h2>Alternative Shapes</h2>

        <p>In addition to the four joining forms (isolated, initial, medial, and final), each Arabic letter can come with different shapes while preserving its joining form. For instance, a typeface or writing style can offer two or more shapes for the final form of a single letter.</p>

        <p>These variant shapes usually have variant widths and hence can be used to adjust the width of the line.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/alternative-letter-shapes.png" alt="Alternative shapes for changing the width of the text.">

          <figcaption>Alternative shapes for changing the width of the text.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>An advantage of using alternative letter shapes when justifying paragraphs is that it does not involve modifying default properties of the typeface (width of space or other characters). Instead, it is using shapes that are part of the typeface and are in harmony with other shapes in the lines.</p>

        <p>But excessive use of alternative shapes, such as using multiple very wide alternatives close to each other, can create unnatural results.</p>

        <p>It is not possible to justify paragraphs using only alternative letter shapes, because these shapes have predefined widths. For example, if a line should get 25 points wider, it is impossible to achieve that by using alternative letter shapes that are, say, 10 or 20 or 30 points wider than the default shapes. But these shapes can make the lines closer to measure, thus reducing the usage of other mechanisms.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="h_justification_ligatures">
        <h2>Ligatures</h2>

        <p>Some Arabic fonts, following the writing styles that use special shapes when joining certain letters, provide a rich number of ligatures. These ligatures can be used in paragraph justification, since they usually reduce the widths of the words.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/different-ligatures.png" alt="Various ligatures reducing the widths of the words">

          <figcaption>Various ligatures reducing the widths of the words</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>But existence of the ligatures in a font does not mean that they can be used freely. A font may provide some of its ligatures for creating an artistic style, which would be unsuitable for texts requiring optimum legibility.</p>

        <p>For that reason, the user should be able to select which sets of ligatures can be used for justification. Fonts can offer predefined sets of ligatures to simplify this process.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="h_justification_kashida">
        <h2>Kashida</h2>

        <p>Kashida refers to extending the horizontal connection between joined letters.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/kashida.png" alt="Two words extended with kashida.">

          <figcaption>Two words extended with kashida.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>This is a feature deeply related with the cursive nature of Arabic script. Kashida is an interesting tool for paragraph justification. It is more flexible than alternative letter shapes and ligatures, because it is not restricted to a limited number of predefined widths. At the same time, it has relatively less effect on the text color than spacing.</p>

        <p>But a proper implementation of kashida involves a number of limitations and considerations.</p>

        <p>Excessive use of kashida or applying very long kashidas results in uneven color. Also, horizontal or vertical proximity of numerous kashida creates an unnatural color.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/too-much-kashida.png" alt="Unpleasant result of excessive use of kashida.">

          <figcaption>Unpleasant result of excessive use of kashida.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Kashida is not always straight. Some fonts may require curvilinear kashidas, which require more advanced implementations.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/curvilinear-kashida.gif" alt="Curvilinear kashida">

          <figcaption>Curvilinear kashida</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Typographers can have preferred places for applying kashidas. In other words, instead of applying kashida between every joined pair of letters, they want it at certain joins.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/tanzil.png" alt="There are multiple joins in this word, but only one is selected for kashida.">

        <h2>Tatweel</h2>

        <p>Tatweel is a dual-joining character that can be inserted between two joined letters to widen their connection. In The Unicode Standard, tatweel is represented as <span class="uname">U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">ـ</span>).</p>

        <p>Tatweel extends letter connections in a fashion similar to kashida, but in a much more limited way. It is a character that has to be in the text or inserted like other characters. It has a predefined width, like any other character.</p>

        <p>Yet it is much simpler to implement, since it acts like normal Arabic characters and does not require special treatment. For this reason, it can be considered useful specially in constrained implementations like fixed-width environments.</p>

        <h2>Combination of the Mechanisms</h2>

        <p>Each of the above six mechanisms have their own limitations and side effects. Utilizing only one of them for justifying paragraphs can create undesirable results. Multiple mechanisms can be used at the same time to work around their limitations and minimize their side effects.</p>

        <p>Since Arabic provides various mechanisms that can be used for justification, an advanced implementation that supports all or most of the above features can produce exemplary justifications. More limited applications can combine what is available.</p>

        <p>Preferences for each mechanisms can depend on the document and text and the preference of the typographers and users. Implementations can enable users to prioritize and control the mechanisms mentioned above.</p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>

    <p>The following tables list Unicode characters used for Arabic script, excluding ASCII. Each table has two columns named <span class="qterm">Ar</span> and <span class="qterm">Fa</span> which denote which characters are used for Arabic or Persian languages, respectively. A black circle (●) under each of these two columns means that a character is used for that language. A white circle (○) denotes a character that is auxiliary for that language. An X mark (✕) means the character is not used for that langauge.</p>
