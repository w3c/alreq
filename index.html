			<h2>Joining Behavior of Characters</h2>

			<p>Arabic script is cursive; i.e, characters are joined to their neighbors. For this purpose, each Arabic letter has at most four different shapes that allows it to join to its neighbors: beside the “isolated” form, there are “initial”, “medial”, and “final” forms. Their purposes, as their names suggest, are as follows:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Isolated shape:</strong> Used when the letter is not joined to any other letter.</li>
				<li><strong>Isolated shape:</strong>Initial shape: Used when the letter is joined only to its next (left-side) letter.</li>
				<li><strong>Isolated shape:</strong>Medial shape: Used when the letter is joined from its both sides.</li>
				<li><strong>Isolated shape:</strong>Final shape: Used when the letter is joined only to its previous (right-side) letter.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><a href="#letter_shapes"></a> shows all four shapes of character <span class="uname">U+0645 ARABIC LETTER MEEM</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0645;</span>).<p>

				<img src="images/letter-shapes.png" alt="Four different shapes for joining to previous or succeeding letters" width="90%" />
				<figcaption>Four different shapes for joining to previous or succeeding letters</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>For each Arabic letter, based on the joining behavior of its neighbors, one of its shapes is used in writing. <a href="#joining_process"></a> demonstrates how letters join to form a word.</p>

			<figure id="joining_process">
				<img src="images/joining-process.png" alt="Joining letters by using their various shapes" width="90%" />
				<figcaption>Joining letters by using their various shapes</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>There are different categories of characters based on their joining behavior, but most of the Arabic letters are either “dual joining” or “right joining”. Dual joining characters can join from both sides. Like the character in image 1, these types of characters have all the four shapes mentioned above. Right joining characters only join to their previous (right-side) character. These characters only have isolated and final shapes, for they don’t join to their next character.</p>

			<p>Almost all the non-alphabetical characters are “non-joining”. The few exceptions will be discussed in this document.</p>

			<p>Please refer to The Unicode Standard Version 8.0, Section 9.2, for full explanation of Arabic cursive joining.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="h_ligatures">
			<h2>Ligatures</h2>

			<p>Almost all the writing styles of Arabic script use a special shape when letters <span class="lettername">lam</span> and <span class="lettername">alef</span> are joined. Most Arabic fonts include mandatory ligatures for this combination. Ignoring this ligature, as shown in <a href="#laam-alef-ligature"></a>, leads to wrong rendering of text.</p>

			<figure id="laam-alef-ligature">
				<img src="images/laam-alef-ligature.png" alt="Correct and wrong ways of rendering letter lam followed by letter alef" width="90%" />
				<figcaption>Correct and wrong ways of rendering letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> followed by letter <span class="lettername">alef</span></figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>This shape is not limited to the combination of <span class="uname">U+0644 ARABIC LETTER LAM</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0644;</span>) with <span class="uname">U+0627 ARABIC LETTER ALEF</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0627;</span>). Variations of letter <span class="lettername">alef</span> such as <span class="uname">U+0622 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH MADDA ABOVE</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0622;</span>) and <span class="uname">U+0623 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH HAMZA ABOVE</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0623;</span>) and also variations of letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> follow the same rules as well. Combination with diacritics does not affect these ligatures. Each of these ligatures also provides a special shape for joining from its right side (to the preceding letter).</p>

    <h2>Font and Typographical considerations</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Typography of body text is the first thing an author
            should care about.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Typography is simply an art and style arrangement of
    characters/words to make a language legible, readable, and
    appealing when displayed.</p>
    
    <p>Typography then has and aesthetic and practical purpose. Good
    typography is a creative and skilled discipline @@..., and its is
    not our goal to describe it more here.</p>
    
    <p>Typography has to do with typefaces (fonts), size of letters,
    word and line spacing, justifications and also the style, the
    arrangement, and the appearance of the letters and the
    layout.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the characteristics Arabic scripts (dots, letters
    shapes, cursively etc...) are challenging for Typography, and to
    ... We begin this section by giving some background on Arabic
    style and Calligraphy and its history.</p>
    
    <h3>Arabic Style and Calligraphy</h3>
    
    <p>Arabic styling and writing has its origin in Islamic art and
    civilization, essentially used to decorate mosques and palaces,
    as well as in beauty manuscripts, books, and especially to copy
    the Koran. Arabic script is cursive  making it viable to
    support  different geometric shapes overlapping and
    composition. Words can bewritten in a verycondensed formas well
    asstretchedinto elongated shapes, so that scribes and artists of
    Islam labored  with passion to take advantage of all these
    possibilities.</p>
    
    <p>From the beginning of Arabic calligraphy, two tendencies or
    two types of styles can be seen emerging, the handwriting for the
    decoration of mosques and sculptures, complex and shaped enough,
    and writing style reserved for writing the Koran, easier to use
    and more readable.</p>
    
    <p>Writings styles / Arabic Scripts then evolved according to
    cultural diversity, leading to regional calligraphic schools and
    styles (<i>Kufi</i> in <i>Iraq</i>, <i>Farissi</i> and
    <i>Taʻliq</i> in <i>Persia</i> or <i>Diwani</i> in
    <i>Turkey</i>), or to the purpose of writing, such as the copying
    and dissemination of the <i>Korʼan</i>.</p>
    
    <p>In general we group under the generic term
    <i><b>Naskh</b></i> (copy/inscription) the scripts
    which are meant for reading at smaller sizes  suitable for
    books and texts to be read, e.g. the <i>Korʼan</i>, and as
    <i><b>Kufi</b></i> <span class="hps atn">(from city of</span>
    <i>Kufa</i> in <i>Irak</i>) the stylish scripts ornaments
    oriented. Although further named styles appeared during the
    richer evolution of  Arabic scripts.</p>
    
    <h3>Different Types  of Writing Style</h3>
    
    <p>Basics and principles of Arabic writing were then defined by
    <i>Ibn Moqlah</i> (886-940 Higra) @@add a ref. Welch 1979@@
    who defined the Six Styles of writing: <i>Kufi</i>,
    <i>Thuluth</i>, <i>Naskh</i>, <i>Riqaʻ,</i> <i>Diwani</i> and
    <i>Taʻliq</i>.<br />
    </p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><i><b>Kufi</b></i></dt>
        
        <dd>One of the oldest and well known Arabic scripts. It is
            characterized by  its decorative and prononced geometric
            forms well adapted for architectural design. The style grew up
            in the beginning of Islam for the need for Muslims to codify
            the Koran. @@ The script has some variations as <i>Al
                Mouthafar</i>,  <i>Al Mukhamal</i>, <i>Al
                    Handassi</i>...)@@</dd>
        
        <dt><i><b>Thuluth</b></i></dt>
        
        <dd>(The third) One of the finest Arabic scripts by its beauty
            and sight. Recognizable by the fact that the letters and words
            are very interleaved in it complex form. May be the most
            difficult in writing (need more skill), both in terms of
            letters or in terms of structure and composition.</dd>
        
        <dt><i><b>Naskh</b></i></dt>
        
        <dd>One of the clearest scripts at all, with clearly
            distinguished letters which facilitates the reading and
            the  pronunciation. Can be written with small size
            (traditionally pens made of reeds and ink) which suits with
            writing longer texts written in boards and books intended for
            general population, especially the Koran. Currently
            <i>Naskh</i> is considered the standard script for almost all
            the Arabic and Muslim world.</dd>
        
        <dt><i><b>Riqa</b></i><u><i>ʻ</i></u></dt>
        
        <dd>The so-called in relation to a patcher, which is gazelle's
            leather. Designed to be used for education, daily (not
            artistic) writing and adopted in the offices (<i>Diwan</i>) of
            the Ottoman Empire.</dd>
        
        <dt><i><b>Ta</b></i><i><b><u><i>ʻ</i></u>liq</b></i></dt>
        
        <dd>aka Farisi(Iran), Taʻliq (hanging) combines <i>Naskh</i>
            and <i>Riqa</i><i><u>ʻ</u></i> (and Thuluth?). Beautiful
            script  characterized by the precision and stretch of its
            letters, its clarity and and lack of complexity. Considered as
            one of the best scripts in the world and is favored by many
            Arabs calligraphers.</dd>
        
        <dt><u><i><b>Diwani</b></i></u></dt>
        
        <dd>Used by Ottman court (<em>Diwan</em>) to write
            official documents. Still in use today (e.g. hand written
            documents by moroccan religious officers).</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <dl>
        <dt><i><b>Nastaaliq Farissi</b></i></dt>
        
        <dd>TBD as Persian version derived from <i>Nas</i>(kh) and
            <i>Taaʻliq</i>. It is like a <i>Taaʻliq</i> but easier to write
            and read...</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h3>Fonts and Styles</h3>
    
    <p>Until recent years, Arabic typefaces were not as common and
    various as the Western ones. Although Arabic was subjected of
    Western printing techniques, the number of different letters,
    absence of upper/lower cases, contextual shapes, the joining of
    the letters result in simplified typefaces.</p>
    
    <p>The reasons might be both technical and historical /
    cultural.</p>
    
    <p>Is this because Arabic world, like other parts in the world,
    came to the computer world more lately than the Western
    world?</p>
    
    <p>According to Bil'Ak,  "Not enough designers from Arabic
    word  have paid attention to creating Arabic fonts or have
    been slow to address challenges presented by adapting Arabic
    script to screens", "May be because there are few specialized
    typography courses available in the Middle East."</p>
    
    <p>Other possible reason, is that not all typographic concepts
    apply all to the Arabic script (e.g. serif, case...) and that
    other characteristics  should be handled carefully for
    better readbility (@@to provide example@@).</p>
    
    <p>Now, many  tools are available to design Arabic fonts, to
    better reach the Arabic language flourishness.</p>
