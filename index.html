<section id="h_introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The aim of this document is to describe the basic requirements for Arabic script layout and text support on the Web and in eBooks. These requirements provide information for Web technologies such as CSS, HTML and digital publications, and for application developers, about how to support users of Arabic scripts. The document focuses on Standard Arabic and Persian.</p>





<section id="h_gap_analysis">
<h3>Gap analysis</h3>

<p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/alreq/gap-analysis/">Arabic &amp; Persian Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Arabic and Persian on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>

<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is identified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>

<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>
</section>




<section id="h_info_requests">
<h3>Other related resources</h3>

<p>The document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>

<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>
</section>





<section id="h_languages">
<h3>Language scope</h3>

<p>This document is focused on two languages: Standard Arabic and Persian.</p>




<section id="h_standard_arabic_language">
<h4>Standard Arabic language</h4>

<p><dfn>Standard Arabic</dfn>—a.k.a. Modern Standard Arabic or Literary Arabic—is the standardized and literary variety of Arabic used in writing and in most formal speech in countries of Northern Africa and West Asia. Regional and classical dialects of Arabic may differ in layout and text details and are <em>not</em> covered by this document.</p>

<p>However, there are some major differences in common practices between the <dfn>Western Arab regions</dfn>—that is North-West Africa—and <dfn>Eastern Arab regions</dfn>—which is North-East Africa and West Asia. For example, the numeral digits used in the two regions and their formatting are vastly different. Although, there's no clear line between the Eastern and Western Arab regions.</p>
</section>




<section id="h_persian_language">
<h4>Persian language</h4>

<p><dfn>Persian</dfn>—a.k.a. Modern Persian—is the standardized and literary variety of the official languages used in Iran and Afghanistan. The dialect of Persian in Iran is also called Western Persian, and is locally known as <span class="qterm">Farsi</span>. The dialect of Persian in Afghanistan is also known as Eastern Persian, and is locally known as Dari.</p>

<p><dfn>Tajik</dfn>—a.k.a Tajiki or Tajiki Persian—is the Persian language as used in Tajikistan. It is written in the Cyrillic script, therefore, is <em>not</em> covered by this document.</p>

<section id="h_arabic_script_overview">
<h2>Characteristics of the Arabic script</h2>



<section id="h_typography">
<h3>Fundamental principles</h3>

<p>Arabic script has some characteristics that are challenging for typographers and font designers. The examples below show some characteristics that require careful consideration. How, even in the simpler <span style="font-style: italic;">naskh</span> style, can typography, which came late to the Arabic world,  follow the tradition of the many authors and artists who manually shaped the Arabic writing over decades?</p>




<section>
<h4>Multi-level baselines</h4>

<p>Letters may join through a finely inclined line.</p>

<figure id="fig_inclined_line">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 132px; height: 62px;" alt=
"slope baseline" src="images/yastabchiro.jpg"></div>
<figcaption>Inclining baseline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Or they may appear on two, square-ended lines.</p>

<figure id="fig_square_ended_lines">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 92px; height: 79px;" alt=
"two level baselin" src="images/yastami3o.jpg"></div>
<figcaption>Dual-level baseline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Multilevel baselines don't occur in all fonts. The above examples use the Arabic Typesetting font. Compare those examples to more typical fonts:</p>

<figure id="fig_single_baselines">
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 110px; height: 93px;" alt="normal Font" src="images/yastabchiroNormal.jpg"></p>
<figcaption>Flat baselines.</figcaption>
</figure>
</section>





<section>
<h4>Multi-context joining</h4>

<p>Rendering of letters depends not only on their place in the word (initial, medial, final) but also on their neighboring letters, i.e. the letter they join with. Each letter has a different appearance in each combination.</p>


<figure id="fig_forms_of_noon">
<img style="width: 324px; height: 79px;" alt="Different initial shape of noon" src="images/differentInitialNoon.jpg">
<figcaption>Initial letter noon, showing many different forms.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Fonts don't always comply with or respect this kind of <span class=
"qterm">tuning</span>. To do so, fonts need many glyphs in order to adapt to each
context. In more modern typefaces some of these connections are implemented by ligatures, but ligatures can't capture or cover all joining behavior.</p>

<p>In the two left most words, the initial noon differs in that one raises a kind of stroke. This property of raising a stroke is common for a number of letters (beh, teh, noon, theh) which are taller than their connected letters in order to be distinguished in some contexts, such as <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 37px; height: 31px;" alt="Beh with stroke before seen" src="images/bsl.jpg"> vs. <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 43px; height: 39px;" alt="Beh without stroke after seen" src="images/sbl.jpg">, or to resolve ambiguity. See also [[[#h_teeth_letters]]].</p>
</section>




<section>
<h4>Words as groups of letters</h4>

<p>A word shape is composed of not (only) a set of "horizontally" connected letters, but  groups of letters (syntagmes).</p>

<p>[[[#fig_word_groups_1]]] shows syntagmes in two words in a naskh font with many glyph variants.</p>

<figure id="fig_word_groups_1">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width: 40%;"><img style="width: 76px; height: 46px;"
alt="Aleph and two groups of letters to form a word" src="images/barmajaAmiri.jpg">
</td>

<td style="text-align: center;width:40%;"><img style="width: 127px; height: 57px;"
alt="two other group of letters" src="images/stimrarihimaArabicTypesetting.jpg">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<figcaption>Groups of letters are colored blue or red.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Compare that with the same words in more plain font:</p>


<figure id="fig_word_groups_2">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; width:40%;"><img style="width: 98px; height: 43px;"
alt="same word in more normal font" src="images/barmajaDefault.png">
</td>

<td style="text-align: center; width: 40%;"><img style=
"width: 144px; height: 46px;" alt="same word in default font" src="images/stimrarihimaDefault.jpg">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<figcaption>Can't really say letter groups. Rather a "horizontal sequence of letters of almost same width".</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Group combinations cannot be covered by general or usual ligatures.</p>
</section>






<section>
<h4>Vertical joining</h4>


<p>Groups of letters may also join vertically (top down) instead of right to left. Not all fonts permit this.</p>

<figure id="fig_vertical_joining">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><img style=
"text-align: center; width: 65px; height: 70px;" alt="Vertical joining" src="images/vertivalJoin.jpg"></td>

<td style="text-align: center;"><img style=
"text-align: center; width: 69px; height: 46px;" alt="horizontal joing" src="images/horizontalJoin.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<figcaption>Almost vertical joining (left), vs. horizontal joins (right).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once again, some fonts try standard ligatures, but this is not ligature. This is
rather (good) writing practice/style.</p>


<p>One should note that all these features have not only an aesthetic side, but also play a role in justification. Choosing a joining style to suit the desired line width is done at the discretion of authors for hand-written text. Applications should provide general rules to emulate these options, but achieving such justification requires sophisticated algorithms.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_teeth_letters">
<h4>The so-called teeth letters.</h4>

<p>Where successive letters have a uniform medial shape, they can be rendered in a way that ressembles teeth.</p>

<figure id="fig_teeth_letters">
<div><img style="width: 276px; height: 74px;" alt="Teeth letters" src="images/teeth.jpg"></div>
<figcaption>"Teeth" letters.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Individual letter shapes may vary according to the context. It's not always the same letters (in red)
which raise the stroke in [[[#fig_teeth_letters]]].</p>

<section id="h_the_islamic_manuscript_tradition">
<h3>The Islamic manuscript tradition</h3>

<section id="h_origins">
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>The Arabic script belongs to the class of Semitic writing systems. It evolved from the Nabatean script, and attained its distinctive form by the 4th century CE. It is closely related to the Syriac and the Hebrew script. The earliest attested document written in the Arabic alphabet in its classical form stems from the Islamic era, it is dated to 643 CE.</p>

<p>According to Islamic belief, the prophet Muhammad received his revelations in the Arabic language. As a consequence, Arabic attained religious connotations. Muhammad's revelations were first compiled and standardised in writing after his death in 632 CE under the caliphs Abu Bakr and 'Uthman. The resulting holy book, the Qur’ān, became a central vehicle of the faith. The Arabic script thus spread with Islamic civilization beyond its origins, and started to be used to write other languages. Because of the wide reach of Islam, numerous, widely differing languages were and are written with the Arabic script. As a result, different orthographies, including variant forms of Arabic letters were conceived. In parallel to these linguistic developments, a plethora of regional styles emerged, making the Islamic manuscript tradition one of the richest in the world.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_writing_styles">
<h4>Writing Styles</h4>

<p>Islamic manuscript practice evolved with Islamic art and civilization. Extant evidence of decorative use of the Arabic script can be found as early as the 7th century CE, in a mosaic band in the Dome of the Rock. Beyond frequent monumental inscriptions in architecture, calligraphy became one of the foremost Islamic art forms. Manuscript practice evolved into a central element of Islamic civilization through the copying of books, and the refinement of calligraphy into a form of fine art. The commissioning and writing of the Qur’ān was seen as an expression of religious devotion and provided the context for scribes and calligraphers to excel in their craft. Further to its use as a textual medium, Arabic calligraphy and lettering crafts developed a rich palette of decorative forms and uses.</p>

<p>A range of styles evolved over time in different regions and for different purposes. These include monumental writing styles used in decorative and representational settings, styles used for the exclusive use of rulers, common hands in different areas, and styles dedicated for specialist purposes such as miniature writing. Many of these styles fell out of use, some evolved further, and some retained a high degree of consistency over time.</p>

<p>There is evidence that both monumental and current hands existed and evolved from the early Islamic era onwards. Various exponents of the monumental styles are often loosely referred to as Kūfī, making it a term that lacks precision and clarity. It describes a group of styles that are marked by an angularity and stark graphic characteristics that are absent from the round scripts that took preeminence from the late 10th, early 11th century CE.</p>

<p>The ‘Abbassīd calligrapher Ibn Muqlah (885/886–940 CE) is recognised for his contribution to the evolution of the round scripts. He articulated a system of proportional relations of Arabic letterforms, which became known as 'The Proportioned Script' (al-khatt al-mansūb), although its precise meaning remains open to interpretation. His work was continued by Ibn al-Bawwāb (d. 1022 CE), and later by Yāqūt al-Musta‘ṣimī (d. 1298 CE), who is credited with refining and canonising six writing styles into their definitive forms. The so-called 'Six Pens' (al-aqlām as-sitta) became the expression of an early high point of Islamic calligraphy. They are grouped in sister scripts of two, in which one is a large, the other a small hand, which share some characteristics. They are (large/small) Thuluth and Naskh, Muhaqqaq and Reyhān, and Tawqi‘ and Riqa‘, and they superceded all preceding styles.
</p>

<p>Other cultural centres of Islamic civilization emerged after the fall of the ‘Abbassīds, and developed their distinct calligraphic styles. Of note is the Persian domain, where the styles Ta‘līq and Nasta‘līq emerged and attained their classical form in the 14th century CE. The Ottoman school began with Sheikh Hamdullah in the late 15th century CE, and built on the Arabic and Persian predecessors. It refined existing styles and invented new hands, to achieve a new high point in the arts of Islamic penmanship.</p>

<p>Today, only a handful of styles are still widely in use, and known. The most prominent style is Naskh, which has become the default form of Arabic in most contexts, notably as a model for typography. However, there is strong regional variance. In Iran and Pakistan Nasta‘līq remains the preferred style for Persian and Urdu respectively, and in the Mashriq Ruq‘ah (not to be confused with Riqa‘) retains a prominent role in casual writing, as well as in lettering. In calligraphic art, other styles are still practised, where notably Thuluth is preeminent.</p>

<dt>Kūfī (كوفي)</dt>

<dd class="flexContainer">
<figure class="floatedFigure" id="fig_abbassid_style">

</figure>


<p>Kūfī is best understood as an umbrella term containing numerous variants, including widely diverging styles such as ornamental Kūfī, square Kūfī, and the so-called Eastern Kūfī, making the term highly ambiguous. The earliest forms of Kūfī are attested from the 7th century CE, making it one of the oldest Arabic writing styles. The Kūfī style that gained prominence in the production of Qur’ān manuscripts from the 7th century CE, also known as ‘Abbassīd style, is characterized by angular forms, with pronounced emphasis of horizontal strokes, very small or closed counter shapes, and uniformity of spacing.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Maghribī (مغربي)</dt>

<dd class="flexContainer">
<figure class="floatedFigure" id="fig_maghribi_style">

<figcaption>Maghribī example [<a href=

</figure>

<p>Like Kūfī, the denomination Maghribī (western) is a generic name that encompasses numerous variants. This class of styles probably evolved from the ‘Abbassīd style when Islamic conquests advanced through North Africa and into the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century CE. It maintained some structural characteristics from the ‘Abbassīd style and evolved further into a distinct regional hand. Used for writing the Qur’ān as well as other scientific, legal and religious
manuscripts. <em>Rabat</em>, a <em><a href="#def_mabsut">mabsut</a></em> version of it, is widely used in some official printings in Morocco.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Thuluth (ثلث)</dt>

<dd class="flexContainer">

<figcaption>Thuluth example [<a href=

</figure>

<p><em>Thuluth</em> is one of the first rounded styles and can be traced back to the late 10th century. Its name probably refers to the width of the pen, which was a third of the pen used for the ancient <em>Ṭūmār</em> style. Canonised as one of the six pens, over time <em>Thuluth</em> acquired preeminence in the Islamic calligraphic arts. It was mainly used for large, decorative applications such as titles, chapters headers, or monumental inscriptions.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Naskh (نسخ)</dt>

<dd class="flexContainer">

</figure>

<p><em>Naskh</em> means ‘copying’, and it is the bookhand par excellence of the Arabic manuscript tradition. It emerged at the end of the 10th century, and developed into distinct regional schools from the 13th century. Over time Naskh became the predominant writing style for continuous text and superseded most earlier styles. When typography was adopted in the Arabic script world, <em>Naskh</em> formed the basis for most types intended for continuous reading.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Taʻlīq (تعليق)</dt>

<dd class="flexContainer">
<figure class="floatedFigure" id="fig_taliq_style">
<img style="width: 130px; height: 200px;" src="images/taliq.jpg" alt="Taʻlīq script">

</figure>

<p><em>Taʻlīq</em> (hanging) is a Persian chancery style. It probably emerged from the older <em>tawqī‘</em> and its definitive form was established by the 13th century. As the name indicates, and owing to the pronounced inclination, it gives the impression of being suspended from above.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Nastaʻlīq (نستعلیق)</dt>

<dd class="flexContainer">

</figure>

<p>The name <em>nastaʻlīq</em> combines <em>naskh</em> and <em>taʻlīq</em>, which may indicate the two influences of this style. <em>Nastaʻlīq</em> became the archetypal writing style of the Persianate world, and attained its definitive form by the late 14th century, although earlier forms are attested. Like taʻlīq it gives a ‘hanging’ impression, and is marked by smooth, flowing curves. Although not widely used for continuous text, nastaʻlīq also found some use for short texts in Arabic.</p>

<dt>Dīwānī (ديواني)</dt>


<dd class="flexContainer">

</figure>

<p><em>Dīwānī</em> was used at the Ottoman court (Dīwān) for official documents, making it a typical chancery script. It developed from the Persian <em>taʻlīq</em> and found use from the late 15th century. Its considerable complexity was intended to preclude forgeries of official documents.</p>

</figure>

<p>The <em>Ruq’ah</em> style evolved from <em>Dīwānī</em> in the 18th century as a fast chancery hand in the Ottoman Empire. It should not be confused with the older <em>Riqā‘</em> that is wholly different. <em>Ruq’ah</em> is still commonly used in the region of the fertile crescent as the preferred hand for everyday use. Its compact proportions give it a dark appearance, and its origins as a small, fast hand lend the shapes a graphic simplicity when enlarged, a feature that makes it popular in contemporary lettering. </p>

<h3>Characters &amp; encoding</h3>


<p>Arabic script is encoded in the Unicode standard <em>semantically</em>, meaning that every letter receives only a single Unicode character, no matter how many different contextual shapes it may exhibit.</p>


<p>Unicode also has a partial set of <em>non-semantic</em> encoded characters for the Arabic script, under blocks <em>Arabic Presentation Forms-A</em> and <em>Arabic Presentation Forms-B</em>, which are deprecated and should not be used in general interchange.</p>


<p>[[[#characters-tables]]] lists characters used for the Arabic and Persian languages. Characters used for these languages include letters and diacritics, three sets of digits (usage depending on the region), punctuation (some common and some specific to the script), symbols, and Unicode formatting characters.</p>


<p>The majority of these characters are common among different languages, though there are three different sets of digits for use by different languages. Most of the alphabetical characters are used by all the languages using Arabic scripts, but there are exceptions, such as the Arabic letter <span class="lettername">yeh</span> being represented with two different characters, <span class="uname">U+064A ARABIC LETTER YEH</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ي</span>) and <span class="uname">U+06CC ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH</span> (<span lang="ar" dir=
"rtl">ی</span>). These differences among the character sets of each language are marked in the appendix tables.</p>


<p>Control characters are used to produce the correct spelling of the words or to ensure correct combination with left-to-right content. Consequently, they should be preserved when storing and displaying texts.</p>

<section id="h_fonts">
<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p>Traditionally, the Arabic alphabet contains 28 letters, though for practical purposes it makes sense to include the hamzah, which increases the number of letters to 29. Numerous letters share the same skeleton and are only distinguished by diacritic signs. Since letters change according to their position in the word, Arabic fonts typically contain hundreds of glyphs. Depending on the design of the font, the inclusion of ligatures, stylistic alternates, contextually sensitive shapes, language localisation, punctuation, etc. can further expand the glyphset. Some contemporary fonts include many hundreds, in some cases even thousands of glyphs.</p>
<p>Early typefaces, some still in use today, incorporated design features based on a variety of simplifications. For example, one of the first approaches  used a "typewriter" style, where the same glyph is used for different positions in a word. This is the case for initial and medial shapes for most  letters. It is generally the browser default font for the Arabic script. A more unifying approach is the use of a single and detached glyphs for each letter without joining. Other approaches were used, producing visual results of more or less practicality.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there is a large choice of fonts, and one can choose the font that best suits  one's typographical desire. However, one may also wish to take into account some non-typographical considerations like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accessibility (readability and visibility).</li>
<li>Devices with a small screen (for example, larger loop and teeth height,
small descenders etc.), although fonts actually appear better on smartphones</li>
<li>Font style for titles and banners and alike (small number of words), may differ from the style for content text (long text).</li>
<li>Shapes and proportions (the size issue) in mixed texts.</li>
<li>Some fonts might give other opportunities for line justification than just the use of word spacing (See [[[#h_ligatures]]]).</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>





<section id="h_ligatures">
<h4>Ligatures</h4>

<p>Almost all the writing styles of the Arabic script use a special shape when the letters
<span class="lettername">lam</span> and <span class="lettername">alef</span> are joined. Most Arabic fonts include mandatory ligatures for this combination. Ignoring this ligature, as shown in [[[#fig_laam_alef_ligature]]], leads to incorrectly rendered text.</p>


<figure id="fig_laam_alef_ligature">
<img src="images/laam-alef-ligature.png" alt="Correct and wrong ways of rendering letter lam followed by letter alef"  style="width:60%">
<figcaption>
Correct and incorrect ways of rendering letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> followed by letter <span class="lettername">alef</span></figcaption>
</figure>


<p>This shape is not limited to the combination <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0644;&#x0627;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0644 ARABIC LETTER LAM</span> + <span class="uname">U+0627 ARABIC LETTER ALEF</span>]</span>. Variations of the  letter <span class="lettername">alef</span> such as <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0622;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0622 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH MADDA ABOVE</span>]</span> and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0623;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0623 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH HAMZA ABOVE</span>]</span> when combined with the letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> follow the same rules. Combination with diacritics does not affect these ligatures. Each of these ligatures also provides a special shape for joining on its right side (to the preceding letter).</p>
</section>







<section id="h_diacritics">
<h4>Diacritics</h4>

<p>More than one diacritic can occur after a single base character and all of them should be visually attached to the same character. Font files usually define special shapes or positioning for combination of diacritics. This extra information should be applied in rendering texts.</p>

<p>[[[#fig_combining_diacritics]]] shows an example, where, according to this
font’s specification, combining U+0651 ARABIC SHADDA and U+0650 ARABIC KASRA changes their positions. Various font files may require different transformations.</p>

<img src="images/combining-diacritics.png" alt="Diacritics could be combined in Arabic script." style="width:60%">
<figcaption>Diacritics could be combined in Arabic script.</figcaption>
</figure>
</section>





<section id="h_diacritic_position">
<h4>Positioning diacritics relative to base characters</h4>

<p>In Arabic script text it is unusual to use diacritics for vowel information and for
consonant lengthening. If they are used, however, there are different approaches to their placement relative to the base characters they modify. Some fonts display short vowel diacritics at the same height, while others vary the height according to the base
character.</p>

<p>Another potential difference arises when a short i vowel diacritic is used with a shadda. In some cases the vowel diacritic remains below the base letter, whereas in other cases the vowel diacritic appears above the base letter, but under the shadda (so that it can be distinguished from the short a vowel diacritic, which appears above the shadda).</p>
</section>
</section>






<section id="h_direction">
<h3>Direction</h3>

<p>Arabic script is written from right to left. Numbers, even Arabic numbers, are written from left to right, as is text in a script that is normally left-to-right.</p>

<p>When the main script is Arabic, the layout and structure of pages and documents are also set from right to left.</p>





<section id="h_bidirectional_text">
<h4>Bidirectional text</h4>

<p>The <dfn data-lt="bidirectional algorithm|bidi algorithm"><a href=
"http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</a></dfn> (or
<span class="qterm">bidi algorithm</span>, for short) [[!UAX9]] details an algorithm for rendering right-to-left text and covers a myriad of situations, mixing different kinds of characters. A simpler explanation of the basics of the algorithm exists in the W3C article <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. [[UBA-BASICS]] You can refer to these documents for more information about Unicode’s bidirectional algorithm.</p>

<p>A brief overview of the <a>bidirectional algorithm</a> follows, because the direction is an essential part of how Arabic script is used.</p>

<p>The characters of a text are digitally stored and transferred in the same order that they are typed by a user. This is the order in which the text is read and pronounced by people and held in memory by software applications, as shown in <a href="#fig_order_in_memory"></a> for a sample text.</p>


<figure id="fig_order_in_memory">
<img src="images/order-in-memory.svg" alt="The order of characters in memory" style="width:80%">
<figcaption>The order of characters in memory.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>But the order used when displaying text is different. The purpose of the bidi algorithm is to find display positions for the characters of a text. These positions are solely used for displaying texts. <a href="#fig_order_when_displayed"></a> shows the same sample text when prepared for display with the bidi algorithm.</p>

<figure id="fig_order_when_displayed">
<img src="images/order-when-displayed.svg" alt="The order of characters when displayed" style="width:80%">
<figcaption>The order of characters when displayed.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An initial step of the process involves determining each paragraph’s <span class=
"qterm">base direction</span>: whether the paragraph is left-to-right or right-to-left. The base direction is either explicitly set by the author, inherited from the page, or (typically for user-generated content) detected based on the content of the paragraph. The base direction has two important uses later in the process.</p>

<p>The next step is to split the text into <span class="qterm">directional runs</span>. Each directional run is a sequence of characters with the same direction.</p>

<figure id="fig_directional_runs">
<img src="images/directional-runs.svg" alt="Splitting a text into 3 directional runs">
<figcaption>Splitting a text into 3 directional runs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Inside each run, all the characters follow the same order. The runs themselves are ordered for visual representation from left to right or from right to left, depending on the base direction of the paragraph. <a href="#fig_order_of_directional_runs"></a> demonstrates an example of this. This is the first effect of the base direction.</p>

<figure id="fig_order_of_directional_runs">
<img src="images/order-of-directional-runs.svg" alt=
"The effect of base direction on the order of runs">
<figcaption>The effect of base direction on the order of runs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unicode has a <span class="qterm">bidi class</span> (or <span class="qterm">bidi
type</span>) property defined for each character that is used to determine the direction of each character. All the Arabic letters are marked as right-to-left characters, while Latin characters have the left-to-right category.</p>

<p>Some characters, mostly punctuations, are <span class="qterm">neutral</span>. The
direction of these characters is derived from their surrounding characters. If a neutral character is surrounded by characters of the same direction (e.g. a space surrounded by Arabic letters), it gets the direction of its neighbors. Otherwise (e.g. a space between an Arabic and a Latin, or a neutral character appearing at the start or the end of a paragraph), the neutral character gets its direction from the paragraph’s base direction. This is another effect of the base direction in the bidi algorithm.</p>

<p>The above explanation of the bidi algorithm is highly simplified, to convey only the
essentials of how Arabic text is transformed for rendering. The actual algorithm deals with many more character types and edge cases. Please refer to <a href=
"https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode

<section id="h_vertical_text">
<h4>Vertical text</h4>


<p>In situations where short runs of text run vertically, for example on book spines or in table headers, Arabic text is rotated to run along the line. It may be rotated so that the tops of the letters face to the left (read the text from top to bottom) or to the right (read the text from bottom to top).</p>


<figure id="fig_vertical_spine">
<img style="width: 89px;" src="images/vertical-rotated-left.png" alt=
"Vertical Arabic top down"> &nbsp; <img style="width: 90px;" src="images/vertical-rotated-right.png" alt="Vertical Arabic bottom up">
<figcaption>Vertical Arabic, top-down and bottom-up flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The flow of text, top-down vs. bottom-up, may depend on regions or authors. The left
case in [[[#fig_vertical_spine]]] is a typically francophone style for book
spines, whereas the right case is an anglophone style.</p>






<section id="h_vertical_embedding">
<h5>Arabic embedded in vertically orientated text</h5>

<p>When Arabic is embedded in body text that is set vertically, such as CJK or Mongolian text, it is also normally rotated so as to run along the line. Typically, the Arabic text will be read from bottom to top of the line.</p>

<p>When the Arabic text spans more than one line, the text is wrapped in the same way as it would be in horizontal text, ie. the first part of the Arabic text is kept on the
first line, and subsequent parts of the Arabic text appear on subsequent lines.
Therefore, in the case of Mongolian, where lines are read left-to-right, the Arabic text lines are also read left-to-right, whereas in Chinese or Japanese, where vertical lines are normally read right-to-left, the Arabic text lines are also read right-to-left.</p>

<section id="h_vertical_upright">
<h5>Upright vertical Arabic text</h5>

<p>There are attested cases of Arabic text arranged vertically with the letters upright, for example in signboards for cinemas or theatres. It is not clear, at this point whether this a standard approach for Arabic text, or just an unusual layout that mimics Western typographic approaches.</p>

<ol>
<li>Letters flow from top to bottom (as with Latin script).</li>

<section id="h_joining">
<h3>Joining</h3>

<p>Arabic script is a cursive writing system; i.e, letters can join to their neighboring letters. Besides the core behavior of the script, there are some details on how content is encoded in Unicode, and some rules around joining behavior when rendering special cases.</p>






<section id="h_joining_forms">
<h4>Joining Forms</h4>

<p>Every Arabic letter has one, two, or four different joining forms, which allow the
letter to join to its neighbors, if applicable. These four forms are:</p>

<ul>
<li><dfn data-lt="isolated">Isolated form</dfn>, used when the letter does not join to
any of the surrounding letters;</li>
<li><dfn data-lt="initial">Initial form</dfn>, used when the letter is joining only to
its next (left-hand side) letter;</li>
<li><dfn data-lt="medial">Medial form</dfn>, used when the letter is joining on both
sides, and</li>
<li><dfn data-lt="final">Final form</dfn>, used when the letter is joined only to its
previous (right-hand side) letter.</li>
</ul>

<p>[[[#fig_letter_meem_shapes]]] shows samples of all four joining forms for <span class="uname">U+0645 ARABIC LETTER MEEM</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang=

<p>We define the following two groups of joining forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><dfn data-lt="join-to-left">Join-to-left forms</dfn>: either Initial form or Medial
form of a letter, which joins to the left-hand side (next) letter. Other forms are called <dfn data-lt="non-join-to-left form">non-join-to-left</dfn>.</li>

<li><dfn data-lt="join-to-right">Join-to-right forms</dfn>: either Medial form or Final

<section id="h_joining_categories">
<h4>Joining Categories</h4>

<p>There are different categories of letters based on their joining behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><dfn data-lt="dual-joining">Dual-joining letters</dfn>: can join from both sides, like the letter in <a href="#fig_letter_meem_shapes"></a>, and has all the four shapes mentioned above.</li>

<li>
<dfn data-lt="right-joining">Right-joining letters</dfn>: can only join to their

<a>final</a> shapes. <a href="#fig_letter_reh_shapes"></a> shows samples of both
forms for U+0631 ARABIC LETTER REH (ر).</li>

<li>
<dfn data-lt="non-joining">Non-joining letters</dfn>: cannot join to any surrounding
letter, and therefore can only take the <a>isolated</a> form. <a href=
"#fig_letter_hamzah_shape"></a> shows a sample of U+0621 ARABIC LETTER HAMZAH (ء) in
its only possible form.</li>

</section>







<section id="h_joining_rules">
<h4>Joining Rules</h4>

<p>There are core rules on how letters join to each other in the Arabic script, which stay valid regardless of the medium (hand-writing, typewriter, movable-type, digital, etc):</p>

<ol>
<li id="joining_rule_1">Letters of each word join together whenever possible,
implicitly.</li>

<li id="joining_rule_2">In some languages, like Persian and Urdu, there are words—mostly, but not limited to, compound words—that require explicit breaks in the joining of letters, although joining would otherwise be possible.</li>

<li id="joining_rule_3">In certain cases, a letter can be in a <a>join-to-left</a> form
without actually connecting to anything on the left, whether there’s any letter or not.
This is often seen in list counters, abbreviations, and other cases where letters do not have a word context, or are taken out of their original word context.</li>

<li id="joining_rule_4">In rare cases of words splitting where letters are joined, first letter of the second half will be in a <a>join-to-right</a> form without any previous letter. This behavior is limited to special cases like blanking specific letters of a word, line breaks in a paragraph, and word breaks across poetry verses. No standalone word can have any letters in <a>join-to-right</a> form without joining on the right-hand side.</li>
</ol>

<p>[[[#fig_joining_process]]] demonstrates how letters join (per Joining Rule
1) to form a word.</p>

<figure id="fig_joining_process">
<img src="images/joining-process.png" alt="Letter BEH and MEEM join to form a word." style="width:60%">
<figcaption>Letters join by taking their relevant form.</figcaption>
</figure>
</section>






<section id="h_joining_control">
<h4>Joining Control</h4>

<p>Arabic letters are represented in their intended joining forms in hand-writing,
typewriters, and old (deprecated) digital encodings of the script. In Unicode, letters are encoded semantically—meaning without any information about their joining form—and therefore there’s need for a mechanism for controlling of the joining behavior of the letters.</p>

<p>In Unicode, by default, neighbor Arabic letters join together if and only if both
letters are able to join towards the other.</p>






<section id="h_disjoining_enforcement">
<h5>Disjoining Enforcement</h5>

<p>As noted in Joining Rule 2, sometimes two Arabic letters sit next to each other (in
one word) which would normally join together, but should not. In Unicode, for such a
case, a special character should be used to enforce disjoining of these letters. This
character is called <span class="uname">U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER</span>, or
<dfn>ZWNJ</dfn> for short.</p>

<figure id="fig_disjoining_enforcement">
<img height="140" src="images/drawings/joining/joining-beh-yeh-zwnj-beh-yeh.png" alt=

<figcaption>Example of using <a>ZWNJ</a> for <a href="#h_disjoining_enforcement">disjoining enforcement</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
</section>







<section id="h_joining_enforcement">
<h5>Joining Enforcement</h5>


<p>Similarly, as noted in Joining Rule 4, sometimes an Arabic letter needs to take a
joining form when it would not happen normally. For example, some abbreviation methods use Initial Form of letters, when possible, for every letter in the abbreviation. Again, in Unicode, a special character should be used to enforce joining on this letter. This character is called <span class="uname">U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER</span>, or <dfn>ZWJ</dfn> for short.</p>

<p>Besides <a>ZWJ</a>, there’s another special Unicode character, <span class=
"uname">U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL</span>, which enforces joining behavior (join causing) on
letters next to it. But, in contrast to <a>ZWJ</a>, <dfn>TATWEEL</dfn> has a glyph shape, looking like a hyphen and usually as wide as the SPACE glyph, which connects to the letters on the main joining line (a.k.a. base-line). So, using <a>TATWEEL</a> would give a similar Joining Enforcement behavior, but has a side effect of wider length for the letter, which is not always desired. That’s why it’s highly recommended to only use
<a>ZWJ</a> for joining control.</p>

<h5>Context-Based Joining</h5>

<h4>Joining Segments</h4>

<p>A sequence of letters that join together are called a <dfn>Joining Segment</dfn>.

<section id="h_closed_joining_segments">
<h5>Closed Joining Segments</h5>

<p>Joining Segments usually have a closed form, meaning that they start in a
<a>non-join-to-right</a> form and end in a <a>non-join-to-left</a> form. <a>Closed
joining segments</a> are the result of segments either start and end with their normal

<p>There are two possible types of closed segments:</p>

<ul>
<li><dfn>Single-Letter Closed Segment</dfn>, which contains only one letter that is in

<p>The cursive nature of the Arabic script requires more attention when applying some visual styles to the texts. It mostly occurs when the implementation assumes letters as separated shapes and does not account for cursive scripts.</p>






<section id="h_joining_and_spacing">
<h5>Joining and Intra-Word Spaces</h5>

<p>The only spaces inside Arabic words are created near characters that are not
dual-joining. When adjusting intra-word spaces (i.e. the space inside the words) only these spaces can be adjusted. Moving two joined characters closer to or further from each other creates undesirable results.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_joining_and_transparency">
<h5>Transparency</h5>

<p>Arabic fonts achieve joining by overlapping letters. A left-joining letter extends out of its bounding box from the left side and a right-joining letter extends out of its bounding box from the right side. Making each letter transparent can expose these
overlapping joinings, which should be avoided. Joining the paths of the joined letter into a single shape can remove the overlappings and create the good results.</p>

<section id="h_joining_and_text_border">
<h5>Text border</h5>

<p>When adding text border, simply adding a border to each letter shape fails to produce the proper result for the Arabic script. A joined letter should not be separated from its joined neighbors by adding border. Like transparency, a way to avoid this is to unify glyph paths into a single big path for all the letters that are joined and add border around that path.</p>

<h5>Styling individual letters</h5>

<p>For educational, technical, or even aesthetic reasons, users might want to apply a
specific style to a single letter (or a few letters) in a word. For example, <a href=
"#fig_omantel_logo_photo"></a> is the logo of the largest telecommunications provider in Oman.</p>

<figure id="fig_omantel_logo_photo">
<img src="images/omantel.jpg" alt="Omantel logo">

<section id="h_segmentation">
<h3>Text Segmentation</h3>

<p>Similar to alphabetic orthographical conventions of Latin script, word-boundaries in
Arabic script can be distinguished by white space and a specific subset of punctuation
marks.</p> 

<p>In case of hand-written Latin script text, the word-space boundaries were introduced
to improve readability of manuscripts. This practice first surfaced in seventh and
eight century CE and was common by thirteenth and fourteenth. [BURNLEY], [SAENGER]</p>

<p>The earliest known example of an Arabic text typeset with movable types which
dates back to 1514, lacks word-space boundaries and shows all characteristics of following the calligraphic tradition. Arabic books typeset by the end of the century show a progression towards using word-space boundaries and by the end of 18th century, the practice is widespread and common.</p>

<p>Regardless of writing systems, since these conventions have emerged over the course of time and as some believe in response to non-orthographic principles of wordhood
[OX-WORD], there are always exceptions existing for them. Some of such special cases and exceptions are detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<span dir="rtl">و</span>" conjunction in Arabic orthography;</li>
<li>"<span dir="rtl">ل</span>" before a non-Arabic script noun (<span dir="rtl">"ل‍ W3C"</span>);</li>
<li>"<span dir="rtl">ب</span>" before a number in Arabic orthography (<span dir="rtl">"ب‍ 42"</span>);</li>
<li>the misuse of space in place of ZWNJ in some Arabic script languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unicode Text Segmentation [[!UAX29]] describes guidelines for determining most significant text boundaries independent of language and orthographic conventions. These guidelines shape a logical set of rules for default boundary determination based on Unicode Standard uniform character model.</p>

<p>Beyond this default boundary determination model, the locale-specific boundary specifications, including cases which require boundary suppression, are available in
[[!CLDR]].</p>

<p>For line segmentation (or more precisely, where line breaks are allowed) see section 4.1 and for details paragraph boundaries see Section 4.3.</p>

<p>In all Arabic numeral systems, numbers are written with the lowest significant digits to the right and the highest digits to the left (a.k.a. left to right), though Arabic script is written from right to left.</p>

<p>An important fact to note here is the <span class="qterm">bidirectional category</span> of these numbers.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a>European digits</a> and <a>Eastern Arabic-Indic digits</a> are of category
<span class="qterm">EN (European Number)</span>.</li>

<li>
<a>Arabic-Indic digits</a> are of category <span class="qterm">AN (Arabic
Number)</span>, differently from their counterpart just above.</li>
</ul>

<p>The difference in bidirectional category between <a>Arabic-Indic digits</a> and
<a>Eastern Arabic-Indic digits</a> is due to the difference in the behavior desired in
Arabic vs. Persian.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the following sentences, having  similar content, result in a very different ordering in a right-to-left context:</p>

<div class="example" dir="rtl">Five is written ۵ in Iran and ٥ in Egypt.</div>

<div class="example" dir="rtl">Five is written ۵ in Iran and 5 in Morocco.</div>

<section id="h_Arabic_number_in_other_uses">
<h4>Arabic number in other uses</h4>

<p>Numbers do not always appear alone, and may appear alongside other characters like financial symbols, fraction signs, decimal and/or thousands signs (excluding math expressions here). Also there are Arabic-specific signs such as <span class="codepoint"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">؉</span> [<span class="uname">U+0609 ARABIC-INDIC PER MILLE SIGN</span>]</span> and <span class="codepoint"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">٪</span> [<span class="uname">U+066A ARABIC PERCENT SIGN</span>]</span>, as well as the Arabic decimal " ٫ " (U+66B) and thousands&nbsp; " ٬ " (U+066C) separators, mentioned earlier. These are mostly used with Arabic-Indic digits.</p>

<p>Numerals can also come separated by or mixed with space or other signs. Example are phone numbers +12&nbsp;34&nbsp;56&nbsp;78&nbsp;89, cars licence plate like 123&nbsp;د‎&nbsp;4,&nbsp; quantities 37.5°, &nbsp; ٥٠ كلم (50km) etc.</p>

<p>Particular attention is needed here. Firstly, numbers have a weak directionality with regards to the Bidi algorithm. For example, alongside a number, certain otherwise neutral characters, such as negative/positive sign, currency or degree symbols, are likely to be treated as part of the number rather than a neutral.</p>

<p>Secondly, the placement of the accompanying signs and symbols may depend on the region: generally Middle East (or anglophone) vs. Western (or francophone) regions. This is not to mention punctuation signs.</p>

<ul>
<li>The percent sign is placed on the left after the number (ie. ٪١٢ not *١٢٪), and without a space (*<span dir="rtl">٪&nbsp;١٢</span>). With European numbers, <span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">%</span> [<span class="uname">U+0025 PERCENT SIGN</span>]</span> is sometimes used, and can be placed either on the right or the left of the digits (eg. 12% or %12).</li>

<li>Arabic decimal and thousand separators obey the same rule as for European numbers (١٬٢٣٤٫٥٦). European signs are used with European numbers (1.234,56 or 1,234.56).</li>

<li>Money or currency signs when they come alongside a number, are placed at the left and treated as part of the number rather than a neutral (€12.3 or €١٢٫٣).</li>

<li>On the other hand, degree signs are placed at the right of the number (37.5°&nbsp;C, ٩٩٫٥°&nbsp;F) or (<span dir="rtl">37.5°&nbsp;م</span>, <span dir="rtl">۹۹٫۵°&nbsp;ف</span>).</li>

<li>When indicating quantity, there should a separating space (<span dir="rtl">12&nbsp;كغ</span>, <span dir="rtl">٤٥&nbsp;مم</span>).</li>

<li>The same rule applies when using range of values. (<span dir="rtl">12-15&nbsp;كغ</span>, but <span dir="rtl">12٪-15٪&nbsp;كغ</span>).</li>

<li><span class="codepoint"><span lang="en">/</span> [<span class="uname">U+002F SOLIDUS</span>]</span> is used for fractions or ratio notation.

<h3>Considerations for mixed-script text</h3>


<p>Arabic ascenders and descenders extend much further than those of the Latin script, and care must be taken to correctly align text in the different scripts when they appear together.</p>

<section id="h_lines_and_paragraphs">
<h2>Lines and Paragraphs</h2>


<section id="h_line_breaking">
<h3>Line breaking</h3>

<p>When Arabic text doesn't fit within the available line width, the text is wrapped to the next line between words.</p>

<p>In bidirectional text, if a line break occurs between a sequence of words that are progressing in a left-to-right direction the first line will be filled with LTR words that come at the start of the phrase in the order spoken (ie. not the visual order when laid out in a single line). This is because it is never correct to read lines from bottom to top. A similar rearrangement is required when a sequence of right-to-left words is split at the end of a line in an overall LTR context.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_justification">
<h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>

<p>Lines of Arabic script text are normally right aligned within the page.</p>

<p>There are a number of different ways to produce justified text in Arabic. In some cases several of these methods may be combined. In other cases, certain methods are disallowed.</p>


<p>Typical methods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expansion or contraction of inter-word spaces.</li>

<li>Expansion or contraction of intra-word spaces, ie. the space following a character in
the middle of a word that doesn't join with the character that follows it.</li>

<li>Use of wider glyph forms for certain characters.</li>

<li>Stretching of the joins between characters, known as 'kashida'.</li>

<li>Use of ligated forms, to reduce space taken by characters on a line.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the four basic justification methods (flush left, flush right, justified, and centered), justified is the most challenging, as it requires changing the widths of the lines to a predefined measure. <dfn>Measure</dfn> refers to the width of a column of text. In a justified paragraph the width of all the lines should be the same as the paragraph’s measure, except the last line.</p>

<p>In Arabic there are six mechanisms for changing the width of a line of text. Each one has its limitations and considerations on when and how it can be applied. Furthermore, different typographers and calligraphers have divergent preferences for these mechanisms.</p>

<p>An important factor in the application of these mechanisms is their success in creating an even <dfn>color</dfn>. The color of the text refers to the amount of ink (or blackness) used to print or show a block of text. Color describes the density of the text against its background. Poorly justifying paragraphs can create uneven distribution of color.</p>

<p>These mechanisms are not exclusive. Quite the contrary, they are commonly used simultaneously to produce better justified paragraphs. Combination of these mechanisms is discussed in <a href="#h_combination_of_the_mechanisms">Combination of the Mechanisms</a>.</p>





<section id="h_adjusting_inter_word_spaces">
<h4>Adjusting Inter-Word Spaces</h4>

<p>This is the same mechanism widely used when justifying Latin scripts, where the width of the spaces between the words can be increased or decreased to change the width of the line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/adjusting-inter-word-spaces.svg" alt=
"Aligning lines by increasing and decreasing spaces between the words." style="width:60%;">
<figcaption>Aligning lines by increasing and decreasing spaces between the words.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A minimum width is defined for how much the space can be shrunk, because putting the words too close to each other creates aesthetic and legibility problems.</p>

<p>Stretching the space too wide is also undesirable, but is utilized as a last resort when it is not possible to use other solutions to make fully justified paragraphs. In some applications a maximum width for the inter-word space is defined as a soft limit (compared to minimum width which is a hard limit). Reaching the maximum width makes the software to try to use other solutions for justification. If no other solution could yield the required
result, the software would fall back to inter-word spacing and stretch the space past the maximum width.</p>

<p>Depending solely on this mechanism for aligning lines in a justified paragraph can lead to unpleasant results, such as rivers (multiple stretched spaces appearing vertically close to each other and forming a white gap inside the paragraph) and uneven distribution of color in the paragraph. Hence, typographers generally use other mechanisms as well to minimize the effect of adjusting inter-word spaces.</p>
</section>





<section id="h_adjusting_intra_word_spaces">
<h4>Adjusting Intra-Word Spaces</h4>

<p>This solution alters the space between letters of each word to change the width of the text. Like adjusting inter-word spaces, this is used for Latin scripts as well, but using it for Arabic script involves considerations specific to Arabic. As noted in <a href="#h_joining_and_spacing">Joining and Intra-Word Spaces</a>, the principal consideration is that gaps between characters only exist for those letters that join only to the right, such as <span class="lettername">dal</span> and <span class="lettername">reh</span> . Adjustment of intra-word space is not relevant where one letter is joined to its neighbors.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/adjusting-intra-word-spaces.png" alt="Altering intra-word spaces between unjoined letters." style="width:50%;">
<figcaption>Altering intra-word spaces between unjoined letters.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Depending on the writing style and the typeface in use, different amounts of alteration to the intra-word space is acceptable for Arabic. Some writing styles allow more liberal adjustments to the closeness of the letter groups, while others can only accept small adjustments in this regard. In any case, much smaller adjustments can be used for intra-word spacing in comparison for inter-word spacing, which naturally is wider and tolerate bigger adjustments.</p>
</section>





<section id="h_alternative_shapes">
<h4>Alternative Shapes</h4>

<p>In addition to the four joining forms (isolated, initial, medial, and final), each Arabic letter can come with different shapes while preserving its joining form. For instance, a typeface or writing style can offer two or more shapes for the final form of a single letter.</p>

<p>These variant shapes usually have variant widths and hence can be used to adjust the width of the line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/alternative-letter-shapes.png" alt="Alternative shapes for changing the width of the text.">
<figcaption>Alternative shapes for changing the width of the text.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An advantage of using alternative letter shapes when justifying paragraphs is that it does not involve modifying default properties of the typeface (width of space or other characters). Instead, it is using shapes that are part of the typeface and are in harmony with other shapes in the lines.</p>

<p>But excessive use of alternative shapes, such as using multiple very wide alternatives close to each other, can create unnatural results.</p>

<p>It is not possible to justify paragraphs using only alternative letter shapes, because these shapes have predefined widths. For example, if a line should get 25 points wider, it is impossible to achieve that by using alternative letter shapes that are, say, 10 or 20 or 30 points wider than the default shapes. But these shapes can make the lines closer to measure, thus reducing the usage of other mechanisms.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_justification_ligatures">
<h4>Ligatures</h4>

<p>Some Arabic fonts, following the writing styles that use special shapes when joining certain letters, provide a rich number of ligatures. These ligatures can be used in paragraph justification, since they usually reduce the widths of the words.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/different-ligatures.png" alt="Various ligatures reducing the widths of the words">
<figcaption>Various ligatures reducing the widths of the words.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But existence of the ligatures in a font does not mean that they can be used freely. A font may provide some of its ligatures for creating an artistic style, which would be unsuitable for texts requiring optimum legibility.</p>

<p>For that reason, the user should be able to select which sets of ligatures can be used for justification. Fonts can offer predefined sets of ligatures to simplify this process.</p>
</section>






<section id="h_justification_kashida">
<h4>Kashida</h4>

<p>Kashida refers to extending the horizontal connection between joined letters.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/kashida.png" alt="Two words extended with kashida.">
<figcaption>Two words extended with kashida.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a feature deeply related with the cursive nature of Arabic script. Kashida is an interesting tool for paragraph justification. It is more flexible than alternative letter shapes and ligatures, because it is not restricted to a limited number of predefined widths. At the same time, it has relatively less effect on the text color than spacing.</p>

<p>But a proper implementation of kashida involves a number of limitations and considerations.</p>

<p>Excessive use of kashida or applying very long kashidas results in uneven color. Also, horizontal or vertical proximity of numerous kashida creates an unnatural color.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/too-much-kashida.png" alt=
"Unpleasant result of excessive use of kashida.">
<figcaption>Unpleasant result of excessive use of kashida.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Kashida is not always straight. Some fonts may require curvilinear kashidas, which require more advanced implementations.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/curvilinear-kashida.gif" alt="Curvilinear kashida">
<figcaption>Curvilinear kashida.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Typographers can have preferred places for applying kashidas. In other words, instead of applying kashida between every joined pair of letters, they want it at certain joins.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/tanzil.png" alt="There are multiple joins in this word, but only one is selected for kashida.">
<figcaption>There are multiple joins in this word, but only one is selected for kashida.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another preference is avoiding multiple kashidas in a single word.</p>
</section>





<section id="h_justification_tatweel">
<h4>Tatweel</h4>

<p>Tatweel is a dual-joining character that can be inserted between two joined letters to widen their connection. In The Unicode Standard, tatweel is represented as <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="ar" dir="rtl">&#x0640;</span> [<span class="uname">U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL</span>]</span>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/tatweel.svg" alt="Tatweel" style="width:60%;">
<figcaption>Tatweel.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tatweel extends letter connections in a fashion similar to kashida, but in a much more limited way. It is a character that has to be in the text or inserted like other characters. It has a predefined width, like any other character.</p>

<p>Yet it is much simpler to implement, since it acts like normal Arabic characters and does not require special treatment. For this reason, it can be considered useful specially in constrained implementations like fixed-width environments.</p>
</section>





<section id="h_combination_of_the_mechanisms">
<h4>Combination of the Mechanisms</h4>

<p>Each of the above six mechanisms have their own limitations and side effects. Utilizing only one of them for justifying paragraphs can create undesirable results. Multiple mechanisms can be used at the same time to work around their limitations and minimize their side effects.</p>

<p>Since Arabic provides various mechanisms that can be used for justification, an advanced implementation that supports all or most of the above features can produce exemplary justifications. More limited applications can combine what is available.</p>

<p>Preferences for each mechanisms can depend on the document and text and the preference of the typographers and users. Implementations can enable users to prioritize and control the mechanisms mentioned above.</p>
</section>
</section>





<section id="h_letterspacing">
<h3>Letter-spacing</h3>

<p>There are situations where Arabic text is stretched for reasons other than justification. Common instances include:</p>


<ul>
<li>In a heading, or a word on a street sign to make it more visible.</li>

<li>Alongside a transcriptions, to make Arabic text the same width.</li>

<li>To mimic voiced emphasis or drawn out sounds</li>
</ul>

<p>These instances do not correspond to letter-spacing in non-cursive scripts, however. Apart
from the fact that the stretching is indicated by stretching the baseline between characters,
the stretching is not usually equidistant between all characters in the stretched text.</p>

      <p>Unicode 6.3 introduced directional isolate characters to replace the more complicated
      directional embedding characters. These new characters are in the process of being supported
      in applications and their usage is encouraged over the old embedding characters. <span class=
      "uname">U+202A LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202B RIGHT-TO-LEFT
      EMBEDDING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING</span>, <span class=
      "uname">U+202D LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE</span>, <span class="uname">U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT

      <p>Also, character <span class="uname">U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE</span> is deprecated
      and should be replaced with <span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span>.</p>
