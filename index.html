      <h2>Encoding</h2>
      <p>Arabic script is encoded in the Unicode standard <em>semantically</em>, meaning that every
      letter receives only a single Unicode character, no matter how many different contextual
      shapes it may exhibit.</p>
      <p>Unicode also has a partial set of <em>non-semantic</em> encoded characters for the Arabic
      script, under blocks <em>Arabic Presentation Forms-A</em> and <em>Arabic Presentation
      Forms-B</em>, which are deprecated and should not be used in general interchange.</p>

      <h2>Joining</h2>
      <section id="h_joining_behavior_of_characters">
        <h2>Joining Behavior of Characters</h2>
        <p>Arabic script is cursive; i.e, characters are joined to their neighbors. For this
        purpose, each Arabic letter has at most four different shapes that allows it to join to its
        neighbors: beside the <span class="qterm">isolated</span> form, there are <span class=
        "qterm">initial</span>, <span class="qterm">medial</span>, and <span class=
        "qterm">final</span> forms. Their purposes, as their names suggest, are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Isolated shape:</strong> Used when the letter is not joined to any other
          letter.</li>
          <li><strong>Initial shape:</strong> Used when the letter is joined only to its next
          (left-side) letter.</li>
          <li><strong>Medial shape:</strong> Used when the letter is joined from its both
          sides.</li>
          <li><strong>Final shape:</strong> Used when the letter is joined only to its previous
          (right-side) letter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="#letter_shapes"></a> shows all four shapes of character <span class=
        "uname">U+0645 ARABIC LETTER MEEM</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">م</span>).</p>

            Four different shapes for joining to previous or succeeding letters
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>For each Arabic letter, based on the joining behavior of its neighbors, one of its
        shapes is used in writing. <a href="#joining_process"></a> demonstrates how letters join to
        form a word.</p>
        <figure id="joining_process">

            Joining letters by using their various shapes
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There are different categories of characters based on their joining behavior, but most
        of the Arabic letters are either <span class="qterm">dual joining</span> or <span class=
        "qterm">right joining</span>. Dual joining characters can join from both sides. Like the
        character in image 1, these types of characters have all the four shapes mentioned above.
        Right joining characters only join to their previous (right-side) character. These
        characters only have isolated and final shapes, for they don’t join to their next
        character.</p>
        <p>Almost all the non-alphabetical characters are <span class="qterm">non-joining</span>.
        The few exceptions will be discussed in this document.</p>
        <p>Please refer to The Unicode Standard Version 8.0, Section 9.2, for full explanation of
        Arabic cursive joining.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h_ligatures">
        <h2>Ligatures</h2>
        <p>Almost all the writing styles of Arabic script use a special shape when letters
        <span class="lettername">lam</span> and <span class="lettername">alef</span> are joined.
        Most Arabic fonts include mandatory ligatures for this combination. Ignoring this ligature,
        as shown in <a href="#laam-alef-ligature"></a>, leads to wrong rendering of text.</p>
        <figure id="laam-alef-ligature">

            by letter <span class="lettername">alef</span>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This shape is not limited to the combination of <span class="uname">U+0644 ARABIC LETTER
        LAM</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ل</span>) with <span class="uname">U+0627 ARABIC
        LETTER ALEF</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ا</span>). Variations of letter <span class=
        "lettername">alef</span> such as <span class="uname">U+0622 ARABIC LETTER ALEF WITH MADDA
        ABOVE</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">آ</span>) and <span class="uname">U+0623 ARABIC
        LETTER ALEF WITH HAMZA ABOVE</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">أ</span>) and also
        variations of letter <span class="lettername">lam</span> follow the same rules as well.
        Combination with diacritics does not affect these ligatures. Each of these ligatures also
        provides a special shape for joining from its right side (to the preceding letter).</p>

  <section id="h_line_breaking">
    <h3><a href="#h_line_breaking">Line breaking</a></h3>
    <p>When Arabic text doesn't fit within the available line width, the text is wrapped to the next line between words. </p>
    <p>In bidirectional text, if a line break occurs between a sequence of words that are progressing in a left-to-right direction the first line will be filled with LTR words that come at the start of the phrase in the order spoken (ie. not the visual order when laid out in a single line). This is because it is never correct to read lines from bottom to top. A similar rearrangement is required when a sequence of right-to-left words is split at the end of a line in an overall LTR context.</p>
    <section class="questions">
      <p>Issues/questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In Urdu words are not necessarily bounded by spaces. What method is used for determining appropriate break points in this case?</li>
        <li>What other characters besides SPACE constitute break points for automatic line wrapping?</li>
        <li>What are the rules for hyphenation in Arabic script text?</li>
        <li>The CSS Text spec <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#example-953e914f">says</a> &quot;When shaping scripts such as Arabic are allowed to break within words due to hyphenation, the characters must still be shaped as if the word were not broken.&quot; The example shows Uighur text with a hyphen at the end of a line and with shaped characters at line end and start. Is this normal in Arabic and Persian text also?</li>
        <li>In some styles of CJK typesetting, English words are allowed to break between any two letters, rather than only at spaces or hyphenation points. Are the rules different form Arabic script text?</li>
        <li>The CSS spec <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#example-b3227dab">says</a> &quot;When shaping scripts such as Arabic are allowed to break within words due to break-all, the characters must still be shaped as if the word were not broken.&quot; Is this true?</li>
        <li>The CSS <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#hanging-punctuation-property">hanging-punctuation</a> property allows the arabic comma and arabic full stop to hang in the margin, rather than wrapping them to the next line. Is this appropriate?</li>

<section id="h_justification">
      <h3><a href="#h_justification">Justification and elongation</a></h3>
      <p>There are a number of different ways to produce justified text in Arabic. In some cases several of these methods may be combined. In other cases, certain methods are disallowed.</p>
      <p>Typical methods include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expansion or contraction of inter-word spaces.</li>
        <li>Expansion or contraction of intra-word spaces, ie. the space following a character in the middle of a word that doesn't join with the character that follows it.</li>
        <li>Use of wider glyph forms for certain characters.</li>
        <li>Stretching of the joins between characters, known as 'kashida'.</li>
        <li>Use of ligated forms, to reduce space taken by characters on a line.</li>
      </ul>
      <section class="questions">
        <p>Issues/questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the rules for elongation of inter-character baselines, and how do they differ from one font style to another?</li>
          <li>When is it appropriate to use which method? </li>
          <li>Is the tatweel character useful?</li>
          <li>What should happen if an application uses a ruq'ah font as a fallback, which cannot allow for word elongation? Does the application need to automatically know that it should not stretch words when using this font style?</li>
          <li>How does an application or person decide which methods to use, and where, to justify text?</li>
          <li>The CSS Text spec says: that, apart from elongation, applications &quot;must assume that no justification opportunity exists between any pair of typographic letter units in cursive script (regardless of whether they join). &quot; Is this correct? InDesign, for example, allows alterations of gaps in the middle of a word where one character doesn't join with the following character.</li>
          <li>Should the CSS <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#cursive-tracking">letter-spacing property</a> have any effect on Arabic script text?</li>

		<p>Unicode 6.3 introduced directional isolate characters to replace the more complicated directional embedding characters. These new characters are in the process of being supported in applications and their usage is encouraged over the old embedding characters. <span class="uname">U+202A LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202B RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202D LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE</span>, <span class="uname">U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE</span> are the old embedding characters and <span class="uname">U+2066 LEFT‑TO‑RIGHT ISOLATE</span>, <span class="uname">U+2067 RIGHT‑TO‑LEFT ISOLATE</span>, <span class="uname">U+2068 FIRST STRONG ISOLATE</span>, and <span class="uname">U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE</span> are the new isolate characters.</p>
