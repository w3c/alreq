      </h3>


      <p>Arabic script is encoded in the Unicode standard <em>semantically</em>, meaning that every
      letter receives only a single Unicode character, no matter how many different contextual
      shapes it may exhibit.</p>


      <p>Unicode also has a partial set of <em>non-semantic</em> encoded characters for the Arabic
      script, under blocks <em>Arabic Presentation Forms-A</em> and <em>Arabic Presentation
      Forms-B</em>, which are deprecated and should not be used in general interchange.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="h_characters">
      <h3><a href="#h_characters">Characters</a>
      </h3>


      <p>Arabic script uses Arabic alphabet, diacritics, numbers, punctuations and symbols, and
      control characters. Appendix <a href="#characters-tables"></a> lists these characters.</p>


      <p>The majority of these characters are common among different languages. There are two
      different set of digits for 0–9 (<span class="uname">U+0660</span>–<span class=
      "uname">U+0669</span> and <span class="uname">U+06F0</span>–<span class=
      "uname">U+06F9</span>) used by different languages. Most of the alphabetical characters are
      used by all the languages using Arabic scripts, but there are exceptions, such as the Arabic
      letter <span class="lettername">yeh</span> being represented with two different characters,
      <span class="uname">U+064A ARABIC LETTER YEH</span> (<span lang="ar" dir="rtl">ي</span>) and
      <span class="uname">U+06CC ARABIC LETTER FARSI YEH</span> (<span lang="ar" dir=
      "rtl">ی</span>). These differences among the character sets of each language are marked in
      the appendix tables.</p>


      <p>Control characters are used to produce the correct spelling of the words or to ensure
      correct combination with left-to-right content. Consequently, they should be preserved when
      storing and displaying texts.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="h_direction">
      <h3><a href="#h_direction">Direction</a>
      </h3>


      <p>Arabic script is written from right to left. Numbers, even Arabic numbers, are written
      from left to right, as is text in a script that is normally left-to-right.</p>


      <p>When the main script is Arabic, the layout and structure of pages and documents are also
      set from right to left.</p>


      <p><a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/">Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</a>
      [[!BIDI]] details an algorithm for rendering right-to-left text and covers a myriad of
      situations in mixing different kinds of characters. A simpler explanation of the basics of
      the algorithm exists in the W3C article <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode
      Bidirectional Algorithm basics</a>. [[UBA-BASICS]] You can refer to these documents for more
      information about Unicode’s bidirectional algorithm.</p>


      <p>A brief overview of the bidirectional (<span class="qterm">bidi</span> for short)
      algorithm follows, because the direction is an essential part of how Arabic script is
      used.</p>


      <p>The characters of a text are digitally stored and transferred in the same order that they
      are typed by a user. This is the order in which the text is read and pronounced by people and
      held in memory by software applications, as shown in <a href="#order_in_memory"></a> for a
      sample text.</p>


      <figure id="order_in_memory">
        <img src="images/order-in-memory.svg" alt="The order of characters in memory">

        <figcaption>
          The order of characters in memory
        </figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>But the order used when displaying text is different. The purpose of the bidi algorithm is
      to find display positions for the characters of a text. These positions are solely used for
      displaying texts. <a href="#order_when_displayed"></a> shows the same sample text when
      prepared for display with the bidi algorithm.</p>


      <figure id="order_when_displayed">
        <img src="images/order-when-displayed.svg" alt="The order of characters when displayed">

        <figcaption>
          The order of characters when displayed
        </figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>An initial step of the process involves determining each paragraph’s <span class=
      "qterm">base direction</span>: whether the paragraph is left-to-right or right-to-left. The
      base direction is either explicitly set by the author, inherited from the page, or (typically
      for user-generated content) detected based on the content of the paragraph. The base
      direction has two important uses later in the process.</p>


      <p>The next step is to split the text into <span class="qterm">directional runs</span>. Each
      directional run is a sequence of characters with the same direction.</p>


      <figure id="directional_runs">
        <img src="images/directional-runs.svg" alt="Splitting a text into 3 directional runs">

        <figcaption>
          Splitting a text into 3 directional runs
        </figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>Inside each run, all the characters follow the same order. The runs themselves are ordered
      for visual representation from left to right or from right to left, depending on the base
      direction of the paragraph. <a href="#order_of_directional_runs"></a> demonstrates an example
      of this. This is the first effect of the base direction.</p>


      <figure id="order_of_directional_runs">
        <img src="images/order-of-directional-runs.svg" alt=
        "The effect of base direction on the order of runs">

        <figcaption>
          The effect of base direction on the order of runs
        </figcaption>
      </figure>


      <p>Unicode has a <span class="qterm">bidi category</span> property defined for each character
      that is used to determine the direction of each character. All the Arabic letters are marked
      as right-to-left characters, while Latin characters have the left-to-right category.</p>


      <p>Some characters, mostly punctuations, are <span class="qterm">neutral</span>. The
      direction of these characters is derived from their surrounding characters. If a neutral
      character is surrounded by characters of the same direction (e.g. an space surrounded by
      Arabic letters), it gets the direction of its neighbors. Otherwise (e.g. a space between an
      Arabic and a Latin, or a neutral character appearing at the start or the end of a paragraph),
      the neutral character gets its direction from the paragraph’s base direction. This is another
      effect of the base direction in the bidi algorithm.</p>


      <p>The above explanation of the bidi algorithm is highly simplified, to convey only the
      essentials of how Arabic text is transformed for rendering. The actual algorithm deals with
      many more character types and edge cases. Please refer to <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/uba-basics">Unicode

      <h3><a href="#h_joining">Joining</a>
      </h3>


      <p>Arabic script is a cursive writing system; i.e, letters can join to their neighboring
      letters. Besides the core behavior of the script, there are some details on how content is
      encoded in Unicode, and some rules around joining behavior when rendering special cases.</p>


      <section id="h_joining_forms">
        <h4><a href="#h_joining_forms">Joining Forms</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Every Arabic letter has one, two, or four different joining forms, which allow the
        letter to join to its neighbors, if applicable. These four forms are:</p>


        <ul>
          <li><strong>Isolated form</strong>, used when the letter does not join to any of the
          surrounding letters;</li>


          <li><strong>Initial form</strong>, used when the letter is joining only to its next
          (left-hand side) letter;</li>


          <li><strong>Medial form</strong>, used when the letter is joining on both sides, and</li>


          <li><strong>Final form</strong>, used when the letter is joined only to its previous
          (right-hand side) letter.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><a href="#letter_meem_shapes"></a> shows samples of all four joining forms for
        <span class="uname">U+0645 ARABIC LETTER MEEM</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang=

        </figure>


        <p>We define the following two groups of joining forms:</p>


        <ul>
          <li><strong>Join-to-left forms</strong>: either Initial form or Medial form of a letter,
          which joins to the left-hand side (next) letter. Other forms are called <span class=
          "qterm">non-join-to-left</span>.</li>


          <li><strong>Join-to-right forms</strong>: either Medial form or Final form of a letter,
          which joins to the right-hand side (previous) letter. Other forms are called <span class=

            <a href="#letter_meem_shapes"></a>, and has all the four shapes mentioned above.
          </li>


          <li>
            <strong>Right-joining letters</strong>: can only join to their previous (right-hand
            side) letter, and therefore, only have isolated and final shapes. <a href=

      <section id="h_joining_rules">
        <h4><a href="#h_joining_rules">Joining Rules</a>
        </h4>


        <p>There are core rules on how letters join to each other in the Arabic script, which stay
        valid regardless of the medium (hand-writing, typewriter, movable-type, digital, etc):</p>


        <ol>
          <li>Letters of each word join together whenever possible, implicitly.</li>


          <li>In some languages, like Persian and Urdu, there are words—mostly, but not limited to,
          compound words—that require explicit breaks in the joining of letters, although joining
          would otherwise be possible.</li>


          <li>In certain cases, a letter can be in a <span class="qterm">join-to-left</span> form
          without actually connecting to anything on the left, whether there’s any letter or not.
          This is often seen in list counters, abbreviations, and other cases where letters do not
          have a word context, or are taken out of their original word context.</li>


          <li>In rare cases of words splitting where letters are joined, first letter of the second
          half will be in a <span class="qterm">join-to-right</span> form without any previous
          letter. This behavior is limited to special cases like blanking specific letters of a
          word, line breaks in a paragraph, and word breaks across poetry verses. No standalone
          word can have any letters in <span class="qterm">join-to-right</span> form without
          joining on the right-hand side.</li>
        </ol>


        <p><a href="#joining_process"></a> demonstrates how letters join (per Joining Rule 1) to
        form a word.</p>


        <figure id="joining_process">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>


      <section id="h_joining_control">
        <h4><a href="#h_joining_control">Joining Control</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Arabic letters are represented in their intended joining forms in hand-writing,
        typewriters, and old (deprecated) digital encodings of the script. In Unicode, letters are
        encoded semantically—meaning without any information about their joining form—and therefore
        there’s need for a mechanism for controlling of the joining behavior of the letters.</p>


        <p>In Unicode, by default, neighbor Arabic letters join together if and only if both
        letters are able to join towards the other.</p>


        <section id="h_disjoining_enforcement">
          <h4><a href="#h_disjoining_enforcement">Disjoining Enforcement</a>
          </h4>


          <p>As noted in Joining Rule 2, sometimes two Arabic letters sit next to each other (in
          one word) which would normally join together, but should not. In Unicode, for such a
          case, a special character should be used to enforce disjoining of these letters. This
          character is called <span class="uname">U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER</span>, or
          <span class="qterm">ZWNJ</span> for short.</p>


          <figure id="disjoining_enforcement">
            <img src="images/TBD.svg" alt="TBD: ZWNJ example.">

            <figcaption>
              Example of using <span class="qterm">ZWNJ</span> for <span class="qterm">disjoining

        <section id="h_joining_enforcement">
          <h4><a href="#h_joining_enforcement">Joining Enforcement</a>
          </h4>


          <p>Similarly, as noted in Joining Rule 4, sometimes an Arabic letter needs to take a
          joining form when it would not happen normally. For example, some abbreviation methods us
          Initial Form of letters, when possible, for every letter in the abbreviation. Again, in
          Unicode, a special character should be used to enforce joining on this letter. This
          character is called <span class="uname">U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER</span>, or <span class=
          "qterm">ZWJ</span> for short.</p>


          <p>Besides <span class="qterm">ZWJ</span>, there’s another special Unicode character,
          <span class="uname">U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL</span>, which enforces joining behavior (join
          causing) on letters next to it. But, in contrast to <span class="qterm">ZWJ</span>,
          <span class="qterm">TATWEEL</span> has a glyph shape, looking like a hyphen and usually
          as wide as the SPACE glyph, which connects to the letters on the main joining line
          (a.k.a. base-line). So, using <span class="qterm">TATWEEL</span> would give a similar
          Joining Enforcement behavior, but has a side effect of wider length for the letter, which
          is not always desired. That’s why it’s highly recommended to only use <span class=
          "qterm">ZWJ</span> for joining control.</p>

        <h4><a href="#h_arabic_style_and_calligraphy">Arabic Style and Calligraphy</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Arabic styling and writing has its origins in Islamic art and civilization, and was
        widely used to decorate mosques and palaces, as well as to create beautiful manuscripts and
        books, and especially to copy the <em>Korʼan</em>. Arabic script is cursive, making it
        viable to support different geometric shapes overlapping and composition. Words can be
        written in a very condensed form as well as stretched into elongated shapes, and the
        scribes and artists of Islam labored with passion to take advantage of all these
        possibilities.</p>


        <p>From the beginning of Arabic calligraphy, two tendencies or two types of styles can be
        seen emerging: writing for the decoration of mosques and sculptures, which was complex and
        highly decorative, and writing styles reserved for writing the <em>Korʼan</em>, which were
        easier to use and more readable.</p>


        <p>Writing styles then evolved under the influences of cultural diversity, leading to
        regional calligraphic schools and styles (<em>Kufi</em> in Iraq, <em>Farsi</em> and
        <em>Taʻlīq</em> in Persia, or <em>Diwani</em> in Turkey). Additional differences arose
        depending on the purpose of writing, such as the copying and dissemination of the
        <em>Korʼan</em>.</p>


        <p>In general we group under the generic term <em><strong>Naskh</strong></em>
        (copy/inscription) the scripts which are meant for reading at smaller sizes and are
        suitable for books and texts to be read, e.g. the <em>Korʼan</em>, and as
        <em><strong>Kufic</strong></em> the highly stylized font styles used for ornamentation and
        more styled writings. Nevertheless, the rich evolution of the Arabic script led to the
        distinctive enumeration of a number of additional named styles.</p>


        <p>Similarly, two other generic terms are used to classify styles : <em>Mabsut</em> (<em>wa
        Mustaqīm</em>) is a form of style that is elongated and straight angled, [which dominated
        the copies of <em>Korʼan</em> in eighth and ninth centuries], and <em>Muqawwar</em> (<em>wa
        Mudawwar</em>) is a form of style that is curved and rounded.</p>

        <p>Basics and principles of Arabic writing were defined by <em>Ibn Moqlah</em> (886-940
        Higra), who defined six styles of writing: <em>Kufi</em>, <em>Thuluth</em>, <em>Naskh</em>,
        <em>Ruqʻa</em>, <em>Taʻlīq</em> and <em>Diwani</em>.</p>

        </h4>


        <p>Arabic script has some characteristics that are challenging for typographers and font
        designers. Examples bellow show some characteristics worth to be considered carefully. How
        could typography, which came late to the Arabic world, then follow the tradition of the
        many authors and artists who manually shaped the Arabic writing over decades? even in it's
        simplest <span style="font-style: italic;">Naskh</span> style?</p>


        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Multi-level baselines</strong>
            </p>


            <p>Letters may join through a finely inclined line</p>


            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 132px; height: 62px;" alt=
            "slope baseline" src="images/yastabchiro.jpg">
            </div>


            <p>or two, square-ended lines</p>


            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 92px; height: 79px;" alt=
            "two level baselin" src="images/yastami3o.jpg">
            </div>


            <p>Multilevel baselines don't occur in all fonts. The above examples use the Arabic
            Typesetting font. Compare those examples to to more typical fonts:</p>


            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img style="width: 110px; height: 93px;" alt=

          <li>
            <p><strong>Multi-context joining</strong>
            </p>


            <p>Rendering of letters depends not only on their place in the word (initial, medial,
            final) but also on their neighboring letters, i.e. the letter they join with. Each
            letter has a different appearance in each combination.</p>


            <figure>
              <img style="width: 324px; height: 79px;" alt="Different initial shape of noon" src=
              "images/differentInitialNoon.jpg">

                Initial letter noon, showing many different forms.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>


            <p>Fonts don't always comply with or respect this kind of <span class=
            "qterm">tuning</span>. To do so, fonts need many glyphs in order to adapt to each
            context. In more modern typefaces some of these connections are implemented by
            ligatures, but ligatures can't capture or cover all joining behavior.</p>


            <p>In the two left most words, the initial noon differs in that one raises a kind of
            stroke. This property of raising a stroke is common for a number of letters (beh, teh,
            noon, theh) which are taller than their connected letters in order to be distinguished
            in some contexts, such as<img style="float: middle; width: 37px; height: 31px;" alt=
            "Beh with stroke before seen" src="images/bsl.jpg"> vs. <img style=

            <p><strong>Words as groups of letters</strong>
            </p>


            <p>A word shape is not (only) a "horizontal" connections of letters, but of groups of
            letters (syntagmes).</p>

            <p>Once again, some fonts try standard ligatures, but this is not ligature. This is

            <p>One should note that all this characteristics has not only an aesthetic side, but
            also play a role in justification. It is at the discretion of (hand writing) authors to
            chose the best kind of joining to suit the desired line width. Should then be a general
            rule on that. But to achieve such justification would require sophisticated
            algorithms.</p>

        <p>Arabic script counts 26 letters, and mostly 19 basic shapes. Since letters change
        according to their position in the word, Arabic set of glyph may range to more than one
        hundred shapes. If one count possible ligatures, and different combination of joining forms
        (see above), the number of glyph can increase further. Not sure that typeface design can
        accommodate all needs, even though some present typefaces can run hundred of shapes.</p>


        <p>Early typefaces, some still in use today, were designed with some facilities. Designer
        of those differs in their simplification hypothesis. For example, one of the first approach
        is to use "type writer style", that is a same glyph for different positions in a word. This
        is the case for initial and medial shape for most of the letters (example here). It is
        generally the browser default font for Arabic script. A more unifying approach is the use
        of a single and detached glyph for each letter without joining (todo example here). Other
        approach were used resulting in more or less visually practical fonts.</p>


        <p>Nowadays, there is a large choice of fonts, and one can choose the font that best suits
        to one's typographical desire. However, one may also wishes to take into account some non
        typographical considerations like: (TBD later on)</p>

          <li>The kind of device with small screen (for example, larger loop and teeth height,
          small descenders etc...), although fonts actually appear better on smartphones</li>


          <li>Font style for titles and banners and alike (small number of words), may differ from
          the style for content text (long text).</li>


          <li>Shapes and proportions (the size issue) in mixed texts</li>


          <li>Some fonts might give another opportunity for line justification than the one based

      <p>In Arabic script text it is unusual to use diacritics for vowel information and for
      consonant lengthening. If they are used, however, there are different approaches to their
      placement relative to the base characters they modify. Some fonts display short vowel
      diacritics at the same height, while others vary the height according to the base
      character.</p>


      <p>Another potential difference arises when a short i vowel diacritic is used with a shadda.
      In some cases the vowel diacritic remains below the base letter, whereas in other cases the
      vowel diacritic appears above the base letter, but under the shadda (so that it can be
      distinguished from the short a vowel diacritic, which appears above the shadda).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>In a heading, or a word on a street sign to make it more visible.</li>


        <li>Alongside a transcriptions, to make Arabic text the same width.</li>

      <p>These instances do not correspond to letter-spacing in non-cursive scripts, however. Apart
      from the fact that the stretching is indicated by stretching the baseline between characters,
      the stretching is not usually equidistant between all characters in the stretched text.</p>


      <div class="issue question">
        <ul>
          <li>Is this really letter-spacing, or is it seen as something different?</li>

        <p>The only spaces inside Arabic words are created near characters that are not
        dual-joining. When adjusing intra-word spaces (i.e. the space inside the words) only these

        <h4><a href="#h_joining_and_transparency">Transparency</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Arabic fonts achieve joining by overlapping letters. A left-joining letter extends out
        of its bounding box from the left side and a right-joining letter extends out of its
        bounding box from the right side. Making each letter transparent can expose these
        overlapping joinings, which should be avoided. Joining the paths of the joined letter into
        a single shape can remove the overlappings and create the good results.</p>

        <p>When adding text border, simply adding a border to each letter shape fails to produce
        the proper result for the Arabic script. A joined letter should not be separated from its
        joined neighbors by adding border. Like transparency, a way to avoid this is to unify glyph
        paths into a single big path for all the letters that are joined and add border around that
        path.</p>

          <p>Arabic numbers are written with the lowest significant digits to
            the right and the highest digits to the left. That arrangement is
            identical to the Western one, even though Arabic script is written
            from right to left. Numbers with many digits use delimiters for the
            decimal part and thousands separator :</p>
          <p>Western digits use comma (U+002C) and full stop (U+002E)
            indifferently as decimal and thousands separator: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1.234,5 in Western (francophone) regions.</li>
            <li>1,234.5 in Middle-East (anglophone) regions.</li>
            <li>Thin space (U+2009) or narrow no-break space (U+202F) may also
              be used as thousands separator.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Arabic-Indic numerals use two specific separators:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arabic Decimal Separator ٫ (U+066B) like comma.</li>
            <li>Arabic Thousand Separator ٬ (U+066C).</li>
            <li>Example : ١٬٢٣٤٫٥&nbsp;.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An important fact to note here is the bidirectional category of
            these numbers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>European Digits (U+0030 - U+0039) are of category "EN - European
              number",</li>
            <li>Arabic-Indic Digits (U+0660 - U+0669) are "AN - Arabic number",</li>
            <li>Eastern Arabic-Indic Digits (U+06F0 - U+06F9) are classified "EN
              - European number", differently from their counterpart just above.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The difference in Bidi category between Arabic-Indic digits and
            Eastern Arabic-Indic digits is due to the difference in Bidi
            behavior desired in Arabic <i>vs</i>. Persian. </p>
          <p class="issue"> What is the origin of this decision.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, a sentence like « Five is written ۵ in Iran and ٥
            in Egypt », say, will give (in RTL context) </p>
          <p>« ‫Five is written ۵ in Iran and ٥ in Egypt‬ » </p>
          <p>requiring the use of markup to correct it. Which is not the case
            with the sentence « Five is written ۵ in Iran and 5 in Morocco ». </p>
        </section>
        <section id="h_Arabic_number_in_other_uses">
          <h4><a href="#h_Arabic_number_in_other_uses">Arabic number in other
              uses</a></h4>
          <p>Numbers do not always appear alone, and may come with other
            characters like financial symbols, fraction sign, decimals and/or
            thousands signs (excluding math expressions here). At first, there
            are proper signs used for the script such as Arabic percent/permille
            sign ٪ (U+066A) and ؉&nbsp; (U+0609), Arabic decimal " ٫ " (U+66B)
            and thousands&nbsp; " ٬ " (U+066C) separators, mentioned earlier and
            mostly used with Arabic-Indics. </p>
          <p>Numerals can also come separated by or mixed with space or other
            signs. Example are phone numbers
            +12&nbsp;34&nbsp;56&nbsp;78&nbsp;89, cars licence plate like
            123&nbsp;د‎&nbsp;4,&nbsp; quantities 37.5°, &nbsp; ٥٠ كلم (50km)
            etc. </p>
          <p>A particular attention is needed here. Firstly, numbers have a weak
            directionality with regards to Bidi algorithm. For example,
            alongside a number, certain otherwise neutral characters, such as
            negative/positive sign, currency or degree symbols, are likely to be
            treated as part of the number rather than a neutral.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the placement of the accompanying signs and symbols may
            depend on regions. Generally Middle East (or anglophone regions) vs.
            Western (or francophone regions). This is not to mention punctuation
            signs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The percent sign is to be placed on the left after the number
              (٪١٢ not ١٢٪), without space (٪&nbsp;١٢). With European numbers,
              the % percent sign is sometime used, and placed indifferently on
              the right or the left of the digits (12% or %12).</li>
            <li>Arabic decimal and thousand sign obey to the same rule as for
              European numbers (١٬٢٣٤٫٥٦). European signs are used with
              European numbers (1.234,56 or 1,234.56).</li>
            <li>Money or currency signs when they come alongside a number, are
              to be placed at the left and be treated as part of the number
              rather than a neutral (€12.3 or €١٢٫٣).</li>
            <li>Unlike degree sign that is to be placed at the right of the
              number (37.5°&nbsp;C, ٩٩٫٥°&nbsp;F) or (<span dir="rtl">37.5°&nbsp;م</span>,
              <span dir="rtl">۹۹٫۵°&nbsp;ف</span>).</li>
            <li>For quantities measurement, there should a
              separating space (<span dir="rtl">12&nbsp;كغ</span>, <span dir="rtl">٤٥&nbsp;مم</span>).
            </li>
            <li>The same apply when using range of values. (<span dir="rtl">12-15&nbsp;كغ</span>,
              but <span dir="rtl">12٪-15٪&nbsp;كغ</span>).</li>
            <li> Solidus sign " / " (U+002F) is used for fraction or ratio
              notation. Fraction are noted for one-half, say, 2/1 or ٢/١, mostly
              in RTL mode. There is no standard way, however, and some
              region/author may write 1/2 for European digits. </li>

      <p>When Arabic text doesn't fit within the available line width, the text is wrapped to the
      next line between words.</p>


      <p>In bidirectional text, if a line break occurs between a sequence of words that are
      progressing in a left-to-right direction the first line will be filled with LTR words that
      come at the start of the phrase in the order spoken (ie. not the visual order when laid out
      in a single line). This is because it is never correct to read lines from bottom to top. A
      similar rearrangement is required when a sequence of right-to-left words is split at the end
      of a line in an overall LTR context.</p>

        <p>There are a number of different ways to produce justified text in Arabic. In some cases
        several of these methods may be combined. In other cases, certain methods are
        disallowed.</p>


        <p>Typical methods include:</p>


        <ul>
          <li>Expansion or contraction of inter-word spaces.</li>


          <li>Expansion or contraction of intra-word spaces, ie. the space following a character in
          the middle of a word that doesn't join with the character that follows it.</li>


          <li>Use of wider glyph forms for certain characters.</li>


          <li>Stretching of the joins between characters, known as 'kashida'.</li>


          <li>Use of ligated forms, to reduce space taken by characters on a line.</li>
        </ul>


      <p>Of the four basic justification methods (flush left, flush right, justified, and
      centered), justified is the most challenging, as it requires changing the widths of the lines
      to a pre-defined measure. <span class="qterm">Measure</span> refers to the width of a column
      of text. In a justified paragraph the width of all the lines should be the same as the
      paragraph’s measure (except, of course, the last line).</p>


      <p>In Arabic there are six mechanisms for changing the width of a line of text. Each one has
      its limitations and considerations on when and how it can be applied. Furthermore, different
      typographers and calligraphers have divergent preferences for these mechanisms.</p>


      <p>An important factor in the application of these mechanisms is their success in creating an
      even <span class="qterm">color</span>. The color of the text refers to the amount of
      ink/blackness used to print or show a block of text. Color describes the density of the text
      against its background. Poorly justifying paragraphs can create uneven distribution of
      color.</p>


      <p>These mechanisms are not exclusive. Quite the contrary, they are commonly used
      simultaneously to produce better justified paragraphs. Combination of these mechanisms is
      discussed in <a href="#h_combination_of_the_mechanisms">Combination of the
      Mechanisms</a>.</p>

        <p>This is the same mechanism widely used when justifying Latin scripts, where the width of

        <p>A minimum width is defined for how much the space can be shrunk, because putting the
        words too close to each other creates aesthetic and legibility problems.</p>


        <p>Stretching the space too wide is also undesirable, but is utilized as a last resort when
        it is not possible to use other solutions to make fully justified paragraphs. In some
        applications a maximum width for the inter-word space is defined as a soft limit (compared
        to minimum width which is a hard limit). Reaching the maximum width makes the software to
        try to use other solutions for justification. If no other solution could yield the required
        result, the software would fall back to inter-word spacing and stretch the space past the
        maximum width.</p>


        <p>Depending solely on this mechanism for aligning lines in a justified paragraph can lead
        to unpleasant results, such as rivers (multiple stretched spaces appearing vertically close
        to each other and forming a white gap inside the paragraph) and uneven distribution of
        color in the paragraph. Hence, typographers generally use other mechanisms as well to
        minimize the effect of adjusting inter-word spaces.</p>

        <h4><a href="#h_adjusting_intra_word_spaces">Adjusting Intra-Word Spaces</a>
        </h4>


        <p>This solution alters the space between letters of each word to change the width of the
        text. Like adjusting inter-word spaces, this is used for Latin scripts as well, but using
        it for Arabic script involves considerations specific to Arabic. As noted in <a href=
        "#h_joining_and_spacing">Joining and Intra-Word Spaces</a>, the principal consideration is
        that gaps between characters only exist for those letters that join only to the right, such
        as <span class="lettername">dal</span> and <span class="lettername">reh</span> . Adjustment
        of intra-word space is not relevant where one letter is joined to its neighbors.</p>


        <figure>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Depending on the writing style and the typeface in use, different amounts of alteration
        to the intra-word space is acceptable for Arabic. Some writing styles allow more liberal
        adjustments to the closeness of the letter groups, while others can only accept small
        adjustments in this regard. In any case, much smaller adjustments can be used for
        intra-word spacing in comparison for inter-word spacing, which naturally is wider and
        tolerate bigger adjustments.</p>
      </section>


      <section id="h_alternative_shapes">
        <h4><a href="#h_alternative_shapes">Alternative Shapes</a>
        </h4>


        <p>In addition to the four joining forms (isolated, initial, medial, and final), each
        Arabic letter can come with different shapes while preserving its joining form. For
        instance, a typeface or writing style can offer two or more shapes for the final form of a
        single letter.</p>


        <p>These variant shapes usually have variant widths and hence can be used to adjust the
        width of the line.</p>


        <figure>
          <img src="images/alternative-letter-shapes.png" alt=
          "Alternative shapes for changing the width of the text.">

          <figcaption>
            Alternative shapes for changing the width of the text.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>An advantage of using alternative letter shapes when justifying paragraphs is that it
        does not involve modifying default properties of the typeface (width of space or other
        characters). Instead, it is using shapes that are part of the typeface and are in harmony
        with other shapes in the lines.</p>


        <p>But excessive use of alternative shapes, such as using multiple very wide alternatives
        close to each other, can create unnatural results.</p>


        <p>It is not possible to justify paragraphs using only alternative letter shapes, because
        these shapes have predefined widths. For example, if a line should get 25 points wider, it
        is impossible to achieve that by using alternative letter shapes that are, say, 10 or 20 or
        30 points wider than the default shapes. But these shapes can make the lines closer to
        measure, thus reducing the usage of other mechanisms.</p>

      <section id="h_justification_ligatures">
        <h4><a href="#h_justification_ligatures">Ligatures</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Some Arabic fonts, following the writing styles that use special shapes when joining
        certain letters, provide a rich number of ligatures. These ligatures can be used in
        paragraph justification, since they usually reduce the widths of the words.</p>


        <figure>

          "Various ligatures reducing the widths of the words">

            Various ligatures reducing the widths of the words
          </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>But existence of the ligatures in a font does not mean that they can be used freely. A
        font may provide some of its ligatures for creating an artistic style, which would be
        unsuitable for texts requiring optimum legibility.</p>


        <p>For that reason, the user should be able to select which sets of ligatures can be used
        for justification. Fonts can offer predefined sets of ligatures to simplify this
        process.</p>

      <section id="h_justification_kashida">
        <h4><a href="#h_justification_kashida">Kashida</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Kashida refers to extending the horizontal connection between joined letters.</p>

          <img src="images/kashida.png" alt="Two words extended with kashida.">

          <figcaption>
            Two words extended with kashida.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>This is a feature deeply related with the cursive nature of Arabic script. Kashida is an
        interesting tool for paragraph justification. It is more flexible than alternative letter
        shapes and ligatures, because it is not restricted to a limited number of predefined
        widths. At the same time, it has relatively less effect on the text color than spacing.</p>


        <p>But a proper implementation of kashida involves a number of limitations and
        considerations.</p>


        <p>Excessive use of kashida or applying very long kashidas results in uneven color. Also,
        horizontal or vertical proximity of numerous kashida creates an unnatural color.</p>


        <figure>

            Unpleasant result of excessive use of kashida.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Kashida is not always straight. Some fonts may require curvilinear kashidas, which
        require more advanced implementations.</p>


        <figure>
          <img src="images/curvilinear-kashida.gif" alt="Curvilinear kashida">

            Curvilinear kashida

        </figure>


        <p>Typographers can have preferred places for applying kashidas. In other words, instead of
        applying kashida between every joined pair of letters, they want it at certain joins.</p>


        <figure>
          <img src="images/tanzil.png" alt=
          "There are multiple joins in this word, but only one is selected for kashida.">

            There are multiple joins in this word, but only one is selected for kashida.
          </figcaption>

        <p>Another preference is avoiding multiple kashidas in a single word.</p>

      <section id="h_justification_tatweel">
        <h4><a href="#h_justification_tatweel">Tatweel</a>
        </h4>


        <p>Tatweel is a dual-joining character that can be inserted between two joined letters to
        widen their connection. In The Unicode Standard, tatweel is represented as <span class=
        "uname">U+0640 ARABIC TATWEEL</span> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">ـ</span>).</p>

            Tatweel

        </figure>


        <p>Tatweel extends letter connections in a fashion similar to kashida, but in a much more
        limited way. It is a character that has to be in the text or inserted like other
        characters. It has a predefined width, like any other character.</p>


        <p>Yet it is much simpler to implement, since it acts like normal Arabic characters and
        does not require special treatment. For this reason, it can be considered useful specially
        in constrained implementations like fixed-width environments.</p>

        <p>Each of the above six mechanisms have their own limitations and side effects. Utilizing

        <p>Since Arabic provides various mechanisms that can be used for justification, an advanced
        implementation that supports all or most of the above features can produce exemplary
        justifications. More limited applications can combine what is available.</p>


        <p>Preferences for each mechanisms can depend on the document and text and the preference
        of the typographers and users. Implementations can enable users to prioritize and control

        <h4><a href="#h_vertical_text">Vertical text</a> </h4>
        <p>In situations where short runs of text run vertically, for example on book spines or in table headers, Arabic text is rotated to run along the line. It may be rotated so that the tops of the letters face to the left (read the text from top to bottom) or to the right (read the text from bottom to top).</p>

        <p>The flow of text, top-down vs. bottom-up, may depend on regions or authors. The left case in <a href="#fig_vertical_spine"></a>is  a typically francophone style for book spines, whereas the right case is an anglophone style. </p>

          <p>When Arabic is embedded in body text that is set vertically, such as CJK or Mongolian text,  it is also normally rotated so as to run along the line. Typically, the Arabic text will be read from bottom to top of the line. </p>
          <p>When the Arabic text spans more than one line, the text is wrapped in the same way as it would be in horizontal text, ie. the first part of the Arabic text is kept on the first line, and subsequent parts of the Arabic text appear on subsequent lines. Therefore, in the case of Mongolian, where lines are read left-to-right, the Arabic text lines are also read left-to-right, whereas in Chinese or Japanese, where vertical lines are normally read right-to-left, the Arabic text lines are also read right-to-left.</p>

      <p>Unicode 6.3 introduced directional isolate characters to replace the more complicated
      directional embedding characters. These new characters are in the process of being supported
      in applications and their usage is encouraged over the old embedding characters. <span class=
      "uname">U+202A LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202B RIGHT-TO-LEFT
      EMBEDDING</span>, <span class="uname">U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING</span>, <span class=
      "uname">U+202D LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE</span>, <span class="uname">U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT
      OVERRIDE</span> are the old embedding characters and <span class="uname">U+2066 LEFT‑TO‑RIGHT
      ISOLATE</span>, <span class="uname">U+2067 RIGHT‑TO‑LEFT ISOLATE</span>, <span class=
      "uname">U+2068 FIRST STRONG ISOLATE</span>, and <span class="uname">U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL
      ISOLATE</span> are the new isolate characters.</p>


      <p>Also, character <span class="uname">U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE</span> is deprecated
      and should be replaced with <span class="uname">U+2060 WORD JOINER</span>.</p>
