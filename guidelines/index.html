	 <h1>Guidelines for using github for i18n documents</h1> 
  </header>
     
  <p class="issue" style="line-height:1;">This is just a first strawman and still needs a lot of work. Do not believe anything it says, and don't expect anything sensible from it!</p>
  <p>The W3C Internationalization Activity has task forces which use github for document development. This page provides guidelines to help people contribute content if they are unfamiliar with github, and includes pointers to style guides also. Some of this information is shamelessly copied directly from <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/docs/github-101.html">the Test the Web Forward documentation</a>.</p>
  <p>For the examples we will use the github username <strong>yoda</strong> and we'll use a real repository (repo) name, <strong>alreq</strong>. You should substitute your own username wherever you see 'yoda', and the name of the repo you want to work with for 'alreq'. Using a real repo as an example will occasionally allow you to see things we would otherwise have to describe, but you shouldn't fork the alreq repo unless that's the one you want to work with.</p>

    <h2>Setting up github</h2> 
	 <ol>
<li><p>Create a GitHub account if you do not already have one on
<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>Download and install the latest version of Git:
<a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a>. Please refer to the instruction there
for different platforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure your settings so your commits are properly labeled:</p>

<p>On Mac or Linux or Solaris, open the Terminal.</p>

<p>On Windows, open Git Bash (From the Start Menu &gt; Git &gt; Git Bash).</p>

<p>At the prompt, type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>This will be the name that is displayed with your test submissions</em></p>

<p>Next, type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git config --global user.email "your_email@address.com"
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>This should be the email address you used to create the account in Step 1.</em></p>

<p>Next, type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git config --global push.default upstream
</code></pre></div>
<p>This ensures that git push will never unintentionally create or update
a remote branch.</p></li>
<li><p>(Optional) If you don't want to enter your username and password every
time you talk to the remote server, you'll need to set up password caching.
See <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git">Caching your GitHub password in Git</a>.</p></li>

     <section>
     <h2><a href="#language">Basic overview of how the process works</a></h2> 
	 <p>The  repository that you contribute to will depend on the document that your task force is working on. For example, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/alreq">https://github.com/w3c/alreq</a>. The following diagram illustrates the basics.</p>
	 <p><img src="images/github-entities.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Diagram showing parts of the github setup."/></p>
	 <p>We'll spend a moment in this section familiarising you with the basic setup. The sections that follow will contain the steps needed to do the things we talk about here.</p>
	 <p>In a typical scenario, you will be working with an <strong>upstream</strong> repository (repo) that has a URL beginning with https:/github.com/<strong>w3c</strong>/. This is the <strong>W3C repo</strong> – it is managed by the people who have editor access for your project, unless you are one of those people you don't have access to this, you can only propose changes to it. You will make a <strong>fork</strong> of that repo on github, which has a URL beginning with https://github.com/<strong>yoda</strong>/. A fork is basically just a copy of the repository on the github site in which you can change things at will. It will be referred to here as the <strong>origin</strong>.</p>
	 <p>Then you will typically <strong>clone</strong> your fork to a directory on your local computer, to make it easier to edit content with authoring tools and the like, however you can just edit on the github site. </p>
	 <p>If you have cloned your fork to your desktop, you should update it regularly so that it matches the W3C repo. You do this by <strong>fetching</strong> the changes from the W3C repo to your local copy and <strong>merging</strong> them with what's on your hard disk. You'll then need to <strong>push</strong> those changes on to your fork on github, so that that is in synch too.</p>
	 <p>As you edit content files on your computer, you'll need to get them into your fork on github. To do this you need to select the files and <strong>add</strong> them (which basically just identifies them as ready for the next stage). Then you <strong>commit</strong> them, and finally you <strong>push</strong> them to your fork.</p>
	 <p>Usually, prior to doing the add, commit, push routine, you would create a <strong>branch</strong>. This is rather like a walled garden within which you'll be making and managing changes. You can have any number of branches.</p>
	 <p>Once you have made changes and you want to send those for incorporation into the W3C repo, and once you have pushed those changes to your fork on the github site, you raise a <strong>pull request</strong> for the branch you were working in. The pull request informs the guardians of the W3C repo that you want to contribute some changes. Those guardians may simply merge your changes into the W3C repo, but typically they will look at your suggestions and allow some time for others to review them. You may need to change some things in the light of feedback before your content is merged with the W3C repo. Sometimes, the editors may take your code and add it themselves rather than just merging the documents.</p>
     </section>
  <section id="localcss2">
       <h2><a href="#localcss">How to make your fork</a></h2>
    <p>Now that you have Git set up, you will need to fork the test repository. This
         will enable you to submit your tests using a pull request (more on this <a href="#submit">below</a>).
         
       <ol>
         <li>
           <p>In the browser, go the the GitHub page for the W3C repository (eg. <a href="https:/github.com/w3c/alreq/">https:/github.com/w3c/alreq/</a>). </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>Click the <img src="images/forkbtn.png" alt="fork"> button in the upper right.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p>The fork will take several seconds, then you will be redirected to your
             GitHub page for this forked repository, eg. https://github.com/<span style="color: brown;">yoda</span>/alreq/. ('yoda' should be replace with your github user name)</p>
         </li>
       </ol>
     </section>
  <section id="localcss3">
    <h2><a href="#localcss">Cloning your forked repo to your desktop</a></h2>

<p>If your fork was successful, the next step is to clone (download a copy of the files).</p>
<p>At the command prompt, cd into the directory where you want to keep the tests, and type the following:</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/yoda/alreq.git
</code></pre></div>
<p>where yoda is your github username, and alreq is the name of the repository.</p>
<p>This will download the tests into a directory named after the repo, eg.
  <code>./alreq</code>.</p>
<p>You should now have a full copy of the test repository on your local
machine. Feel free to browse the directories on your hard drive. You can also
browse them on <a href="https://github.com/w3c">github.com</a> and see the full history of contributions
there.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="localcss4">
    <h2><a href="#localcss">Additional housekeeping</a></h2>
    <p>You should do a little housekeeping before going further.</p>

<ol>
<li>
  <p>On the command line, navigate to the directory where your forked copy of
the repository is located.</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ cd &lt;pathname&gt;/alreq
</code></pre>
  </div>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that you are on the <strong>gh-pages branch</strong>.  This will  be the case if you
just forked, otherwise switch to gh-pages.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
  <p>Next, check that git knows about the upstream repository you forked (ie. the W3C repo).  This assigns the
W3C repository to  "upstream":</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git remote -v
</code></pre>
  </div>

<p>It should say </p>
<pre>origin	  https://github.com/<em>yoda</em>/<em>alreq</em>.git (fetch)
origin	  https://github.com/<em>yoda</em>/<em>alreq</em>.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/<em>w3c</em>/<em>alreq</em>.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/<em>w3c</em>/<em>alreq</em>.git (push)</pre>
<p>If it doesn't, set upstream as follows:</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/w3c/alreq.git
</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
  </section><section id="localcss4">
    <h2><a href="#localcss">Synchronising your local files and your fork with the W3C repo</a></h2>
    <p>You should regularly keep your local copy of the files up-to-date with the latest commits in the W3C
repository.</p>

<ol>
<li>
  <p>On the command line, navigate to the directory where your forked copy of
the repository is located.</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ cd &lt;pathname&gt;/alreq
</code></pre>
  </div>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that you are on the <strong>gh-pages branch</strong>.  This will  be the case if you
just forked, otherwise switch to gh-pages.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
  <p>To pull in changes in the W3C repository that are not present in your
    local repository first <strong>fetch</strong> them:</p>
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git fetch upstream
</code></pre></div>
  <p>Then merge them into the directories on your local system:</p>
  <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git merge upstream/gh-pages
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
  <p>Finally you will want to make sure that these changes get into your forked repo on github too. To do this, push the changes to your fork:</p>
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push
</code></pre>
  </div>
</li>
</ol>

  <section id="localcss5">
  <h2><a href="#localcss">Making changes and proposing them</a></h2>
    <p>Now we describe steps in the process of creating content and requesting that it be merged into the content on the W3C repo.</p>
    <p><strong>Before you start on these steps</strong>, ensure that you have fetched the latest files from the W3C repo by following the steps in the previous section! </p>
    <p><strong>Also, ensure that</strong> you start from the gh-pages branch, otherwise you'll end up with a horrible nested mess and you'll be very embarrassed because someone will have to spend a while digging you out. You have been warned!</p>
    <section>
    <h3>Create a new branch</h3>
    <p>At the command line, check you are on the gh-pages branch:</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre></div>
    <p>Then create a <strong>new branch</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git checkout -b myBranchName
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will create a branch named <code>myBranchName</code> and immediately
switch this to be your active working branch.</p>

<p>The branch name should describe specifically what you are testing.
For Example:</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git checkout -b arabic-joining-forms
</code></pre></div>
    </section>
 
  <section>
    <h3>Make the changes to your content</h3>
    <p>Edit the files you want to change or create.</p></section>
  <section>
    
    
   <section>
    <h3>Prepare your files for submission</h3>
<p>Before you submit your changes for review and contribution to the W3C
repo, you'll need to first commit them locally, where you now have your own
personal version control system with git. In fact, as you are making your changes, you may want to save versions of your work as you go before you submit
them to be reviewed and merged.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you're ready to save a version of your work, go to the command
prompt and cd to the directory where your files are.</p></li>
<li><p>First, ask git what new or modified files you have:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git status
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will show you files that have been added or modified.</p></li>
<li><p>For all new or modified files, you need to tell git to <strong>add</strong> them to the
list of things you'd like to commit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git add [file1] [file2] ... [fileN]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git add [directory_of_files]
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Run <code>git status</code> again to see what you have on the 'Changes to be
committed' list. These files are now 'staged'.</p>
<p>(Alternatively, you can run <code>git diff --staged</code>, which will show you the
diff of things to be committed.)</p></li>
<li><p>Once you've added everything, you can <strong>commit</strong> and add a message to this
set of changes:</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git commit -m "New section on Arabic joining forms"
</code></pre></div>
<p>Make the message as short but as informative as possible. Others will need to get a clear idea of what these changes are about by reading this text.</p></li>
<li>
  <p>Repeat these steps as many times as you'd like before you submit your changes for inclusion in the W3C repo.</p></li>
</ol>  <section>
    
    
  <section>
  <h3>Request that your changes be incorporated into the W3C repo</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first thing you do before submitting changes to the W3C repo is to push
them back up to your fork on the server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push origin </code><code>myBranchName</code><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">
</code></pre>
</div>
<p> Here, <code>origin</code> refers to your fork of the repo on the github server. You just use the word origin, git should know where that is.
<code>myBranchName</code> should be the name of your branch that
created earlier.</p></li>
<li>
  <p>Now you can send a message that you have changes or additions you'd like
to be reviewed and merged into the W3C repository. You do
this by using a pull request. In a browser, open the GitHub page for your
forked repository, eg. <a href="https://github.com/yoda/alreq/">https://github.com/yoda/alreq/</a>.</p></li>
<li>
  <p>Now create a <strong>pull request</strong>.  There are several ways to create a PR in the
GitHub UI.  Below is one method and others can be found on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">GitHub.com</a></p>

<p>a. Click on the <img src="images/new-pull-request.png" alt="new pull request"> button.</p>

<p>b.  On the left, you should see the base repo is the
w3c/alreq. On the right, you should see your fork of that
repo, yoda/alreq. In the branch menu of your forked repo, switch to <code>myBranchName</code>.  If you see <em>'There isn't anything to compare'</em>, click the
<img src="images/editbtn.png" alt="edit"> button and make sure your fork and your <code>myBranchName </code>branch is selected on the right side.</p>

<p>c. Select the <img src="images/createprlink.png" alt="create pull request"> link at the top.</p>

<p>d. Scroll down and review the diff.</p>

<p>e. Scroll back up and in the <code class="kw" translate="no">Title</code> field, enter a brief description for
your submission, eg. "New section on Arabic joining forms." Once again, make this as short and informative as possible.</p>

<p>f.  If you'd like to add more detailed comments, use the comment field
below.</p>

<p>g.  Click <img src="images/sendpullrequest.png" alt="the send pull request button"></p></li>
<li><p>Wait for feedback on your pull request.</p></li>
</ol>
  <section>
    
   <section><h3>Modify your submission</h3><p>Once you submit your pull request, a reviewer will check your proposed changes
for correctness and style. It is likely that this process will lead to some
comments asking for modifications to your code. When you are ready to make the
changes, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>
  <p>If you are no longer in the branch you were previously working on (in examples above this was <code>myBranchName</code>), check it out again, eg.</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git checkout myBranchName
</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Make the changes needed to address the comments, and commit them just like
before.</p></li>
<li>
  <p>Push the changes to the  branch on your forked repo:</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push origin myBranchName
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
  <p>The pull request will automatically be updated with the new commit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes it takes multiple iterations through a review before the changes are
finally accepted. Don't worry about this, it's totally normal. The goal of 
review is to work together to create the best possible content for your task force.</p></section>
   
   <section><h3>Cleaning up</h3>
   <p>Once your pull request has been accepted, you will be notified in the GitHub
UI and you may get an email. At this point, your changes have been merged
into the W3C repo. You do not need to take any further action
on the files you submittted, but you should delete your branch. This can easily be done in
the GitHub UI by navigating to the pull requests and clicking the
'Delete Branch' button.</p>

<p><img src="images/praccepteddelete.png" alt="pull request accepted delete branch"></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can delete the branch on the command line.</p>
<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ git push origin --delete &lt;myBranchName&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Then fetch the latest files from the W3C repo and push them to your fork, as described earlier, so that you are up to date with everything.</p></section>
  </section>
  
  <p class="issue">From this point on add info about style and markup guidelines.</p>
     <section id="localcss">
       <h2><a href="#localcss">Local CSS styling</a></h2> 
	 <p>You should declare any CSS that is specific to your document in a

		<h2><a name="graphics" id="graphics">Graphics, tables and figures</a></h2> 
		<p>The implementation of graphics deviates slightly from XMLSpec standard usage. A <code>figure</code> element has also been provided.</p> 
		<p>All tables and all non-inline pictures should be enclosed in a <code>figure</code> element <em>after</em> the preceding paragraph. </p> 
		<p>In the generated XHTML, figures can have a caption. If, and only if, a caption is supplied, it will start with "Figure X: " in the XTHML,
		  where X is the sequential number of the figure in the document. The text "Figure X: " is generated by the XSLT, and you must not add that to the XML.
		  The use of captions is encouraged.</p> 
		<p>You should always provide a value for the id attribute, on the <span class="kw">example</span> element (not the head). (See
		  <a href="#example-ref">how to refer to figures</a> from the text.)</p> 
		<p>All graphic images included in the text, whether in a figure or within a paragraph, should be created with an <code>image</code> element.
		  The <span>graphic</span> element that comes with xmlspec must not be used. The <code>image</code> element has two children, <code>img</code> and
		  <code>alt</code>. <code>img</code> has attributes <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> and you are encouraged to use them; <code>img</code> has
		  no <code>alt</code> attribute, since an <code>alt</code> <em>element</em> is provided as a child of <code>image</code>. This approach assists
		  translators, but also allows the alt text to be marked up (eg. with bidi or language information, or <code>ins</code> or <code>del</code> tags). You
		  should always provide alt text.</p> 
		<p>All graphics files should be stored in the <code>images</code> directory (eg. the <code>source</code> attribute would point to
		  <code>images/graphicName.gif</code>).</p> 
		<p>Note that alt text should describe the picture so that someone unable to see it can derive the same conclusions as someone who can. This
		  generally means describing the point being made by the picture rather than the visual elements.</p></div-->

	   <h2><a href="#lists">Lists</a></h2>
    <p>A colon should be used for a sentence that leads into the list.</p> 
		<p>If a list is expressed as a single sentence each list item should 
begin with a lower case letter and end with a comma or ", and".&nbsp; 
The
		  last list item should end with a full stop.</p> 
		<p>Example:</p> 
		<p class="example">Every W3C specification <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p> 
		<ol class="example"> 
		  <li>conform to the requirements applicable to specifications, </li> 
		  <li>specify that implementations MUST conform to the requirements applicable to software, and </li> 
		  <li>specify that content created according to that specification MUST conform to the requirements applicable to content.</li> 
		</ol> 
		<p>Otherwise, each list element should begin with an uppercase letter and end with a full stop.</p> 
		<p>Example:</p> 
		<p class="example">Some aspects of Unicode that require additional specification for the Web include:</p> 
		<ul class="example"> 
		  <li>Choice of encoding forms (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32). </li> 
		  <li>Counting characters, measuring string length in the presence of variable-length encodings and combining characters). </li> 
		  <li>Duplicate encodings (e.g. precomposed vs decomposed). </li>
