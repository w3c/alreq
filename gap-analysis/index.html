    <p>This document describes and prioritises gaps for the support of Arabic and Persian languages on the Web and in eBooks. In particular, it is concerned with text layout.

  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
  <p>This page documents issues for a given script or language in terms of support by specifications or user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.). A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/alreq/">Text Layout Requirements for the Arabic Script</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<h2>Characters and phrases</h2>
    
    
    
<section id="encoding" class="ok">
    <h3>Encoding considerations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any character repertoire issues preventing use of this script on the Web? Do variation selectors need attention?</p>

<p></p>
</section>



<section id="fonts" class="tbd">
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Do the standard fallback fonts used in browsers (eg. serif, sans-serif, cursive, etc.) match expectations? Are special font or OpenType features needed for this script that are not available?  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="fontstyle" class="advanced">
    <h3>Font styles</h3>
    <p id="fontstylePrompt" class="status_prompt"> Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>There should be means available to control the direction in which 'italicised' or 'oblique' text slants, since in some schools of Arabic script typography, text in these styles need to slant to the left.</p>
</section>



<section id="glyphs" class="advanced">
    <h3>Glyph control</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>



    <p>For advanced typographic purposes, the fixed position of diacritical marks relative to base letter or baseline and the logical stacking behvaior of them might not be sufficient. Therefore, it should be possible to adjust the positioning and combining order and changes to the individual marks when combining. Fonts and other systems may implement the logic needed to result in an optimal presentation of diacritical mark clusters by default.</p>
</section>



<section id="cursive" class="basic">
    <h3>Cursive text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> If this script is cursive (eg. Arabic, N'Ko, Syriac, etc), are there problems or needed features related to the handling of cursive text? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#cursive">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acursive%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Various changes in styling currently break cursive connections. This should not happen. (Add details).</p>
</section>



<section id="transforms" class="na">
    <h3>Transforming characters</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does your script need special text transforms that are not supported? Does your script convert letters to uppercase, capitalised and lowercase alternatives according to your typographic needs? Do you need to to convert between half-width and full-width presentation forms? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#transforming_characters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-transform%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="numbers" class="ok">
    <h3>Numbers &amp; digits</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">If  the script has its own set of number digits, are there any issues in how they are used? Does the script or language use special format patterns that are problematic?  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#numbers">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Anumbers%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Internationalization software libraries identify Arabic-Indic numerals as the set of numerals which should be used with text in Arabic language excluding a number of Arabic-speaking countries of Northern and Northwestern Africa which should use Arabic (ASCII) numerals. Surveys of publications, monetary and governmental documents, and manuscripts confirm these precedences. However, there is a considerable diverging trend from these recommendations observable on the web, digital products, and in user-generated content. If not considered in design and implementation of software products dealing with Arabic text, this discrepency could be potentially disadvantageous to the quality of text layout, digital typography, and locale-specific data processing.</p>
    </section>



<section id="boundaries" class="ok">
    <h3>Text boundaries &amp; selection</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">When you double- or triple-click on the text, is the expected range of characters highlighted? When you move through the text with the cursor, or backspace, etc. do you see the expected behaviour? Are there issues when applying punctuation than could be fixed by the application? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#graphemes">See available information</a>  or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aboundaries%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="quotations" class="basic">
    <h3>Quotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any issues when dealing with quotations marks, especially when nested? Should block quotes be indented or handled specially? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#quotations">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aquotations%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>In HTML and CSS the styling applied to nested multilingual quotations when using the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element chooses quotation marks based on the language of the text inside the quotation, rather than outside.</p>
</section>



<section id="spacing" class="basic">
    <h3>Inter-character spacing</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Many scripts create emphasis or other effects by spacing out the letters or syllables in a word. We know there are questions here about how this should work in Indic and SE Asian scripts, and in Arabic-based scripts.  Are there requirements for other scripts that we should add? (For justification related spacing, see below.) See <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#letter_spacing">available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainline-spacing%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>It is very common in Arabic script to stretch words or phrases to a particular width (eg. to match a Latin translation or transcription above or below). This is achieved by lengthening the connections between letters, and to some extent by use of wide glyph variants, etc. The rules for which part of the text to stretch and how far are complicated - this is not the even spacing that usually occurs in tracked Latin text. There are currently no mechanisms for managing this process effectively in HTML/CSS.</p>
</section>



<section id="ruby" class="na">
    <h3>Ruby annotation</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">The ruby spec currently specifies an initial subset of requirements for fine-tuning the typography of phonetic and semantic annotations of East Asian text, including furigana, pinyin and zhuyin fuhao systems.  Is is adequate for what it sets out to do?  What other controls will be needed in the future? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#ruby_annotation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aruby%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p></p>
</section>



<section id="textdecoration" class="basic">
    <h3>Text decoration</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations. Do underlines need to be broken in special ways for this script? Do you need support for additional line shapes or widths? Does the distance or position of the lines relative to the text need to vary in ways that are not achievable? Are lines correctly drawn relative to vertical text? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#text_decoration">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-decoration%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>It must be possible to position under- and overlines further away from the baseline than for Latin text. There is not currently a way to achieve effective underlining in a way that works with the Arabic script.</p>
</section>



<section id="emphasis" class="ok">
    <h3>Emphasis &amp; highlights</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Bold and italic are not always appropriate for expressing emphasis, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing it, that are not in the Western tradition at all. Does this script require support for emphasising or highlighting text that cannot be achieved currently?  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#emphasis">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aemphasis%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="bidi" class="basic">
    <h3>Bidirectional text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">If this script runs right-to-left, are there any issues when handling that? Is bidirectional text adequately supported? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#bidirectional_text_direction">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Edge still doesn't support directional isolation.</p>
    <p>There are questions about how to transmit information about the expected directional behaviour of certain strings.</p>
    <p>RLI, LRI, etc are still not well supported.</p>

<section id="linebreak" class="ok">
    <h3>Line breaking</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the browser capture the rules about the way text in your script wraps when it hits the end of a line?  What characters should not appear at the end or start of a line, and what should be done to prevent that? Does line-breaking wrap whole 'words' at a time, or characters, or something else (such as syllables in Tibetan)? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#line_breaking">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aline-break%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p>No hyphenation is used for Arabic when used with Arabic and Persian languages.</p>
</section>



<section id="justification" class="advanced">
    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> When text in a paragraph needs to have flush lines down both sides, does it follow the rules for your script? Does the script need assistance to conform to a grid pattern? Does your script allow punctuation to hang outside the text box at the start or end of a line? Where adjustments are need to make a line flush, how is that done? Do you shrink/stretch space between words and/or letters? Are word baselines stretched, as in Arabic? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#justification">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ajustification%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>For justification of Arabic script text, there are various common strategies available. These could be categorized in two major groups; strategies based on adjusting inter-word or inter-character whitespace and strategies based on adjusting the letterforms. </p>
    <p>A basic implementation must provide at least one of these strategies for adequate  justification results. Advanced implementations should provide users with the necessary means to control the selection of strategies, adjustment of their attributes, and the priority with which they are being applied. </p>
    <p>Currently, CSS specifications do not provide these advanced features, but recommend that the implementations  select the justification strategy appropriate to the text. </p>
    <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/alreq/#h_justification">Arabic Layout Requirement</a> document includes a section dedicated to this topic.</p>
    </section>



<section id="counters" class="basic">
    <h3>Counters, lists, etc.</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">The CSS Counter Styles specification describes a limited set of simple and complex styles for counters to be used in list numbering, chapter heading numbering, etc. Are the details correct? We have another document that provides over 120 templates for user-defined counter styles in over 30 scripts. Are there more? Are there other aspects related to counters and lists that need to be addressed? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#counters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acounter-styles%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Arabic script text uses local counter styles. While some of these are supported by some browsers, the set of symbols used and their order varies by language. Custom counter styles can be created using Firefox only. The CSS spec needs to become a Rec and more browsers need to support it.</p>
</section>



<section id="initialletter" class="ok">
    <h3>Initial letter styling</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the browser or ereader correctly handle special styling of the initial letter of a line or paragraph, such as for drop caps or similar? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#initial_letter">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainitial-letter%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Although initial letter styling is not an innate feature of the Arabic script, there have been occurences of its usage noted. However, the specifications and guidelines for composition of these decorative elements are undefined or insubstantial; for example, which of the joining forms of letters is to be used or how the joining behaviour is treated accross the boundary between the styled initial letter and rest of the paragraph.</p>
    </section>



<section id="baselines" class="ok">
    <h3>Baselines &amp; inline alignment</h3>

    <h2>Layout &amp; pages</h2>

<section id="bidilayout" class="basic">
    <h3>Bidirectional layout</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">When content can flow vertically and to the left or right, how do you specify the location of objects, text, etc. relative to the flow? For example, keywords 'left' and 'right' are likely to need to be reversed for pages written in English and page written in Arabic. <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#direction_agnostic">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>There needs to be wider adoption of logical keywords such as start and end, rather than left and right.</p>

<section id="vertical" class="na">
    <h3>Vertical text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are the script requirements for vertically oriented text met?  What about if you mix vertical text with scripts that are normally only horizontal? Do you need a switch to use different characters in vertical vs. horizontal text? Does the browser support short runs of horizontal text in vertical lines (tate-chu-yoko in Japanese) as expected? Is the orientation of characters and the directional ordering of characters supported as needed? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#vertical_text">See available information</a>.</p>



    <p>We need to clarify whether there is a particular requirement for handling arabic text specially in vertical lines, such as upright glyphs. We are also waiting on implementation of sideways values of writing-modes in order to be able to effectively use arabic text in vertical arrangements (such as book spines, table headings, etc), but that is not a problem specific to arabic.</p>

    <h3>Notes, footnotes, etc.</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does your script have special requirements for notes, footnotes, endnotes or other necessary annotations of this kind in the way needed for your culture? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#notes_footnotes">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Anotes-footnotes%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>Other page layout &amp; pagination features</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Some cultures define page areas and page progression direction very differently from those in the West (eg. kihon hanmen in Japanese). Is this an issue for you? Are widows and orphans relevant? In what order do pages progress, RTL or LTR? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#more_page_layout_and_pagination">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Apagination%20label%3Atype-info-request%20label%3Aarabic">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>Culture-specific features</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Sometimes a script or language does things that are not common outside of it sphere of influence. This is a loose bag of additional items that weren't previously mentioned.

    <h3>What else?</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">There are many other CSS modules which may need review for script-specific requirements, not to mention the SVG, HTML, Speech, MathML and other specifications. What else is likely to cause problems for worldwide deployment of the Web, and what requirements need to be addressed to make the Web function well locally?</p>
